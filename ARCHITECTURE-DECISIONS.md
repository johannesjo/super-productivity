# Architecture Decision Records

This document tracks significant architectural decisions and patterns in the Super Productivity codebase. When making changes that affect these patterns, reference this document and update it if needed.

It is also the **index** of accepted decisions: a decision recorded somewhere else — because it is long enough to stand alone, or because it is enforced as a contributor rule — must still be listed under [Decisions Recorded Elsewhere](#decisions-recorded-elsewhere).

## Active Patterns & Decisions

### 1. dueDay/dueWithTime Mutual Exclusivity Pattern

**Status**: ✅ Active (since commit `400ca8c1`, 2026-01-29)

**Decision**: The `task.dueDay` and `task.dueWithTime` fields are mutually exclusive in new data. When setting `dueWithTime`, `dueDay` must be cleared (set to `undefined`). When reading, `dueWithTime` takes priority over `dueDay`.

**Rationale**:

- Prevents state inconsistency bugs where both fields had conflicting values
- Single source of truth for task scheduling
- Simpler state management

**Implementation**:

- **Writing**: Clear `dueDay` when setting `dueWithTime` (in meta-reducers)
- **Reading**: Check `dueWithTime` first; only check `dueDay` if `dueWithTime` is not set (in selectors)
- **Legacy Data**: Old data with both fields works via priority pattern (no migration needed)

**Key Files**:

- [`task.model.ts`](src/app/features/tasks/task.model.ts) - Field definitions with JSDoc
- [`task-shared-scheduling.reducer.ts`](src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/task-shared-scheduling.reducer.ts) - Write implementation
- [`work-context.selectors.ts`](src/app/features/work-context/store/work-context.selectors.ts) - Read pattern
- [`planner.selectors.ts`](src/app/features/planner/store/planner.selectors.ts) - Read pattern
- [`task.selectors.ts`](src/app/features/tasks/store/task.selectors.ts) - Read pattern

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Adding new date/time scheduling fields
- Modifying task scheduling logic
- Working with task selectors that check due dates

---

### 2. TODAY_TAG Virtual Tag Pattern

**Status**: ✅ Active (established pattern)

**Decision**: `TODAY_TAG` (ID: `'TODAY'`) is a **virtual tag** whose membership is determined by `task.dueWithTime` or `task.dueDay`, not by `task.tagIds`. The tag's `taskIds` field stores only the ordering of tasks, not membership.

**Key Invariant**: `TODAY_TAG.id` must NEVER be added to `task.tagIds`

**Rationale**:

- Uniform move operations across all tags (virtual and regular)
- Single source of truth for "today" membership (date fields, not tagIds)
- Self-healing ordering (stale entries automatically filtered)
- Natural integration with planner (which uses date fields)

**Related**: Uses the dueDay/dueWithTime mutual exclusivity pattern (Decision #1)

**Key Files**:

- [`tag.const.ts`](src/app/features/tag/tag.const.ts) - TODAY_TAG definition
- [`work-context.selectors.ts`](src/app/features/work-context/store/work-context.selectors.ts) - Membership computation
- [`task-shared-helpers.ts`](src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/task-shared-helpers.ts) - Invariant enforcement

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Adding new virtual tags
- Modifying tag membership logic
- Working with today's task list

---

### 3. Sync Package Boundary Direction

**Status**: ✅ Active (since May 2026)

**Decision**: Operation-log sync code is split by dependency direction:
`src/app` composes host-specific wiring, `@sp/sync-providers` owns bundled
provider implementations, and `@sp/sync-core` owns framework-agnostic reusable
sync primitives.

**Rationale**:

- Keeps reusable sync algorithms independent of Angular, NgRx, app models, and
  provider implementations
- Prevents provider IDs, app action/entity enums, validation schemas, UI, OAuth,
  and platform bridges from leaking into the core engine package
- Gives boundary lint a clear rule: packages never import app code, and
  providers consume only public sync-core exports

**Implementation**:

- ESLint rejects Angular, NgRx, app, shared-schema, sync-core deep imports, and
  dynamic imports inside package sources
- `@sp/sync-core` has no runtime dependencies and owns vector-clock algorithms
  used by client/server compatibility paths
- `packages/shared-schema` compatibility-re-exports generic vector-clock
  algorithms from `@sp/sync-core`; `@sp/sync-core` must not import
  `@sp/shared-schema`
- `@sp/sync-providers` depends on public `@sp/sync-core` plus provider runtime
  helpers, while app factories inject credentials, platform bridges, validators,
  OAuth routing, and config

**Documentation**: [`docs/sync-and-op-log/package-boundaries.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/package-boundaries.md)

**Key Files**:

- [`packages/sync-core/src/index.ts`](packages/sync-core/src/index.ts) - Core public API
- [`packages/sync-providers/package.json`](packages/sync-providers/package.json) - Provider public exports
- [`eslint.config.js`](eslint.config.js) - Package boundary enforcement
- [`src/app/op-log/sync-providers/sync-providers.factory.ts`](src/app/op-log/sync-providers/sync-providers.factory.ts) - App-side provider composition

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Moving sync code between app and packages
- Adding a package export or dependency
- Adding a provider implementation or plugin-facing provider contract
- Changing vector-clock ownership or shared-schema compatibility

### 4. Upload Conflict Safety via the lastSeq Row Lock Under RepeatableRead

**Status**: ✅ Active (since May 2026; batch upload engine removed August 2026)

**Decision**: SuperSync uploads derive conflict-safety from the shared
`user_sync_state.lastSeq` row write that reserves server sequence numbers, not
from PostgreSQL RepeatableRead snapshot isolation alone.

**Note — batch upload engine deleted (2026-08, #9508)**: this decision was
originally written for the batch upload engine (`processOperationBatch`,
`prefetchLatestEntityOpsForBatch`, the `SUPERSYNC_BATCH_UPLOAD` flag). That
engine was never enabled in production and was deleted rather than rolled out;
the serial per-op path (`processOperation`) is the only upload engine. The
invariant below is engine-neutral and applies unchanged to the serial path.
The deleted batch code last lived at commit `924ddd7019`. Re-open condition:
the batch engine processed a 25-op upload in ~10 SQL statements vs ~127 for
serial — resurrect it (from that commit, re-reviewed) only if per-upload
latency or transaction lock-hold time becomes a measured production problem.

**Rationale**:

- PostgreSQL RepeatableRead does not provide full serializable snapshot isolation
- Two concurrent upload transactions can both pass conflict checks when they
  read the same pre-insert snapshot
- Reserving sequence numbers through one `user_sync_state.lastSeq` row forces
  accepted writers for the same user to serialize on that row lock
- A causal `REPAIR` snapshot must prove that its state includes the current
  server prefix; the same row serializes that base-cursor check with later writes
- If two uploads race, the later writer blocks on the row and the transaction
  retry path handles the serialization failure rather than silently accepting
  conflicting operations
- The serial path's post-allocation conflict re-check ("FIX 1.5", removed
  2026-08; last lived at commit `07511ab45c`) was dead code: under
  RepeatableRead both conflict checks read one snapshot fixed at the
  transaction's first statement, and the `lastSeq` increment raises a
  serialization failure (40001) against any committed concurrent upload
  before a re-check could run. Lowering the isolation level below
  REPEATABLE READ would require reinstating a post-allocation re-check.

**Implementation**:

- An upsert ensures the `user_sync_state` row exists (`lastSeq: 0`); each
  accepted operation then reserves its sequence number with an atomic
  `update({ lastSeq: { increment: 1 } })` on that row
  (`operation-upload.service.ts`)
- The operation insert uses `createMany(..., skipDuplicates: true)`: a lost
  duplicate-ID race surfaces as `count === 0` and is handled in-transaction
  (sequence rolled back, op classified as `DUPLICATE_OPERATION`) rather than
  aborting the whole upload with a unique-constraint error; only a non-ID
  unique conflict aborts the transaction
- `REPAIR` uploads persist `repairBaseServerSeq` on the operation row. The HTTP
  handler rejects an obviously stale base before quota cleanup, and the upload
  transaction repeats the check under `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` before insertion
- Regular uploads carrying `lastKnownServerSeq` use the same per-user row lock
  to reject an upload behind the latest `SYNC_IMPORT` or `BACKUP_IMPORT` before
  insertion. The durable replacement marker is reconciled lazily from retained
  operations for rows created before the marker existed.
- Markerless legacy repairs are compatibility records, not causal boundaries:
  they cannot drive download fast-forward, snapshot trust, history pruning, or
  server-generated restore points; snapshot replay across one fails closed
- Removing or sharding the `lastSeq` write requires replacing this safety
  mechanism with an equivalent per-user serialization primitive

- [`packages/super-sync-server/tests/integration/repair-causality.integration.spec.ts`](packages/super-sync-server/tests/integration/repair-causality.integration.spec.ts) - Real-PostgreSQL race coverage

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Changing upload conflict detection
- Changing server sequence assignment
- Changing transaction isolation for upload operations
- Changing repair base-cursor validation or full-state history pruning
- Changing the state-replacement upload fence
- Introducing multi-writer or multi-region upload processing

### 5. Project Completion: Decoupled Resolution over Atomic Multi-Entity Op

**Status**: ✅ Active (since 2026-06-06, branch `feat/completing-projects-48eeb4`)

**Decision**: "Complete project" is a **plain single-entity `PROJECT` flag flip** (`completeProject`, `OpType.Update`, mirroring `archiveProject` → sets `isDone`/`doneOn`/`isArchived`). The accompanying resolution of unfinished tasks ("move to Inbox" / "mark done") runs **first, as the normal per-task actions** (`moveToOtherProject` / `updateTask isDone`) dispatched in a loop with the Rule&nbsp;#6 bulk-dispatch flush — **not** bundled into a single atomic multi-entity op.

**Rationale**: An earlier iteration made completion one atomic `Batch` op (`completeProject`) that marked/moved tasks inside the project-shared meta-reducer. Because that op deliberately routed **around** the normal per-task actions, every system that observes those actions had to be re-taught about `completeProject` separately:

- **Conflict detection** needed a whole new `affectedEntities` multi-entity-ref feature threaded through sync-core, the sync server (+ a Prisma migration), shared-schema and the op-log — ~1,565 LOC, of which `completeProject` was the **only** producer.
- **Native-reminder cancellation**, **issue two-way-sync**, **time-block sync** and **repeat-cfg** effects each needed a dedicated `completeProject` listener to re-derive the task changes the atomic op skipped.

The atomic op's headline benefit — reversing the whole thing as one unit — was never realized: `reopenProject` only clears the project flags; it does **not** un-move or un-complete the resolved tasks. So the bundle paid a large cross-cutting cost for an undo guarantee it didn't provide. Decoupling makes the existing effects and per-entity conflict detection fire naturally and deletes ~1,750 LOC total (revert + decouple). Trade-off accepted: completion now emits **N+1 ops** (one per resolved task + the flag flip) instead of one, and there is a brief intermediate state — both fine for a rare, user-initiated action whose resolution is not atomically reversible anyway. One behavioral nuance vs. the old atomic op: when unfinished work is **moved to Inbox**, a task that was being actively tracked stays the current task (it was carried forward, not finished — consistent with Inbox's carry-forward intent); the **mark-done** path stops tracking the current task via the existing `autoSetNextTask$` effect. The atomic op cleared the current task in both cases; the decoupled design intentionally keeps it for the carry-forward case.

**Implementation**:

- **Action/reducer**: `completeProject({ id, doneOn })` in `project.actions.ts`; `on(completeProject)` flag flip in `project.reducer.ts` (guards `INBOX_PROJECT`). `reopenProject` clears the flags only.
- **Service**: `ProjectService.complete(id, doneOn)` dispatches the flag flip; `moveTasksToInbox()` / `markTasksDone()` loop the normal per-task actions + `setTimeout(0)` flush.
- **Flow**: `work-context-menu` resolves unfinished work **before** calling `complete()`.
- **Do NOT** reintroduce a multi-entity `completeProject` op or `affectedEntities` for it without re-justifying the full downstream cost above. Prior atomic implementation is preserved in history at commit `0893a86162`.

**Key Files**:

- [`project.actions.ts`](src/app/features/project/store/project.actions.ts), [`project.reducer.ts`](src/app/features/project/store/project.reducer.ts)
- [`project.service.ts`](src/app/features/project/project.service.ts) — `complete` / `moveTasksToInbox` / `markTasksDone`
- [`work-context-menu.component.ts`](src/app/core-ui/work-context-menu/work-context-menu.component.ts) — `completeProject()` flow

**When to Update This Decision**:

- Adding a true bulk meta-reducer action for general use (revisit whether completion should adopt it)
- Reworking how completion resolves unfinished tasks
- Any proposal to make completion a single synced op again

---

### 6. Passkeys Stay Pending Until Email Verification

**Status**: ✅ Active (since July 2026)

**Decision**: A passkey submitted during account registration is stored as a
`PendingPasskeyRegistration` tied to its exact email-verification token. It is
promoted to the user's active `Passkey` set only when that token is consumed.

**Rationale**:

- A WebAuthn registration ceremony proves possession of a credential, not
  ownership of the email address entered alongside it.
- Storing a submitted credential directly on an unverified user lets an attacker
  pre-register a victim's address, then have the victim's later magic-link
  verification activate the attacker's passkey.
- Keeping separate pending attempts prevents concurrent registrations from
  replacing or activating one another. The email owner chooses the credential
  by consuming the link produced by that same registration attempt.
- Failed email delivery leaves the bounded, expiring pending attempt in place.
  Deleting the shared unverified user can race a concurrent registration and
  invalidate a link that was successfully delivered.

**Implementation**:

- Passkey registration stores no active credential and creates one pending row
  per verification token.
- Email verification atomically claims the unverified user, replaces active
  passkeys with the credential bound to that token, and deletes the user's
  remaining pending attempts.
- Passkey verification tokens live only on pending registrations; user-row
  verification tokens belong to magic-link registrations. Consuming a user-row
  token verifies the email but removes untrusted active and pending passkeys.
- The migration moves the latest legacy credential for each unverified user to
  the pending table and removes all active credentials from unverified users.
- The resend cap bounds pending rows per unverified account; rows also expire
  with their verification tokens.

**Key Files**:

- [`auth.ts`](packages/super-sync-server/src/auth.ts)
- [`passkey.ts`](packages/super-sync-server/src/passkey.ts)
- [`schema.prisma`](packages/super-sync-server/prisma/schema.prisma)

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Changing passkey enrollment or email-verification flows
- Adding another credential type to registration
- Changing verification-token persistence or cleanup

### 7. Versioned Delete-Wins Semantics for Project Deletion

**Status**: ✅ Active (since July 2026)

**Decision**: Project deletions created with schema v4 or newer carry an explicit
`projectDeleteWins` marker and beat concurrent project updates. Historical,
unmarked deletions keep timestamp-based LWW semantics.

This is a deliberate semantic trade-off: a concurrent project rename or field
edit that is vector-clock CONCURRENT with a marked delete **loses**, regardless
of which has the newer wall-clock timestamp. Deleting an entity another device is
editing wins over the edit — the alternative (timestamp LWW) resurrects an empty
project shell and silently loses its task subtree. The lost edit is only
recoverable via local undo, not via sync.

**Rationale**:

- `deleteProject` is one user intent whose reducer cascade removes the project,
  active tasks, notes, sections, repeat configuration, and related archive data.
  Reversing only the project entity after that operation loses data and violates
  replay determinism.
- Capturing every cascaded entity in the delete payload or emitting restoration
  sidecars makes payload size scale with project size and still cannot restore
  every side effect safely.
- Deletion is the only complete, deterministic result already represented by the
  operation. A concurrent rename or project-field edit must not partially undo it.
- The schema-v4 barrier makes clients that do not understand this conflict policy
  stop before applying the operation (they block on the newer-schema gate rather
  than mis-resolving). The **absence** of the payload marker on historical
  deletions — never added by the no-op v3→v4 migration — is what preserves their
  timestamp-LWW semantics; the marker, not the version number, is the real
  discriminator. The classifier additionally requires the marked delete's
  plaintext `entityId` to match its authenticated payload `projectId`, so a
  tampered/replayed delete retargeted onto a live entity cannot win.

**Implementation**:

- New `deleteProject` actions include `projectDeleteWins: true`; replacement
  delete operations preserve that payload.
- The shared LWW planner accepts a host-supplied delete-wins classifier. A remote
  marked delete is applied regardless of timestamps. A local marked delete is
  replaced with one operation whose vector clock dominates both conflict sides.
- SuperSync keeps its generic conflict protocol: if the first delete upload is
  rejected, the existing retry path uploads the causally dominant replacement.
  File-based providers use the same client planner and marker.
- Do not add per-task/note restoration operations or project-sized snapshots to
  compensate a losing marked project delete.

**Key Files**:

- [`task-shared.actions.ts`](src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared.actions.ts) — the `PROJECT_DELETE_WINS_MARKER` producer
- [`conflict-resolution.ts`](packages/sync-core/src/conflict-resolution.ts)
- [`conflict-resolution.service.ts`](src/app/op-log/sync/conflict-resolution.service.ts) — the delete-wins classifier
- [`schema-version.ts`](packages/shared-schema/src/schema-version.ts)
- [`project-delete-wins-barrier-v3-to-v4.ts`](packages/shared-schema/src/migrations/project-delete-wins-barrier-v3-to-v4.ts) (registered in [`migrations/index.ts`](packages/shared-schema/src/migrations/index.ts))

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Changing the cascade performed by `deleteProject`
- Adding another operation with delete-wins conflict semantics
- Changing schema compatibility or LWW replacement behavior

### 8. Additive Data-Model Evolution over Schema Bumps

**Status**: ✅ Active (since August 2026)

**Decision**: Persisted and synced data evolves **additively**. Pick the change
channel by what actually changed (table below). Do not raise
`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` unless a change is **both** inexpressible as an additive
or derived field **and** would be _misapplied_ — not merely ignored — by older
clients. This is the constructive counterpart to the bump policy (sync rule 10),
which says when not to bump but not what to do instead.

| What changed                                                   | Channel                                                               | Precedent                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Local storage layout (stores, indexes, derived meta)           | `DB_VERSION` ladder — local only, never transmitted                   | `db-upgrade.ts` v7 seeds the full-state-ops meta store |
| Shape of stored state (new field, legacy key, changed default) | Read-time normalization in the `loadAllData` reducer                  | `migrateFocusModeConfig`, `migrateKeyboardConfig`      |
| Representation of an existing **synced** field                 | Dual field — new field wins, legacy re-derived from it on every write | `normalizeStartOfNextDayConfig`                        |
| Semantics of an operation                                      | Payload marker / envelope, inert on older clients                     | `LwwUpdatePayload`; the v4 `projectDeleteWins` marker  |

**Rationale**:

- A bump fences only receivers that ship _after_ it. Released v17.0.0–v18.14.0
  clients apply ops up to schema 5 unmigrated and, at ≥ 6, block them while still
  advancing the cursor — permanently skipping them. A bump therefore never buys
  safety against the clients actually writing today's data.
- It cannot be reverted once any op carries the new version, and it hard-blocks
  every lagging post-v18.14.0 client on a frozen cursor.
- The legacy fleet does not age out on its own: there is **no desktop
  auto-updater** (the block in `electron/start-app.ts` is commented out) and the
  update banner's dismissal is persisted. Any policy gated on "wait for the old
  fleet to shrink" is a permanent no in disguise.
- Additive fields are safe by construction here: typia uses `createValidate`
  (excess properties are neither rejected nor stripped) and LWW patch application
  goes through `updateOne`, a shallow merge that retains unknown keys. **Renames
  and removals are the dangerous shape** — an old client that wins a conflict
  re-emits the entity without the field, destroying it fleet-wide — and no bump
  prevents that, because old clients keep writing regardless.

**Evaluation record (2026-08)**: raising `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` to 5 was
considered and **declined**. Neither candidate motivation survived: the
accumulated optional-field/runtime-default debt needs no migration (that pattern
_is_ the answer, per sync rule 11), and the typed RRULE recurrence model can ship
as an additive field while the flat fields stay canonical and re-derived — see
#9664, which also corrects that plan's inverted cross-version gate. A migration
with no payload is pure cost.

**Implementation**: no new machinery — each channel above already exists and has
a shipped precedent.

**Documentation**: [Bump Policy §A.7.11](docs/sync-and-op-log/operation-log-architecture.md#bump-policy--a-bump-does-not-protect-the-released-fleet), [`persisted-model-fields.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/persisted-model-fields.md), `AGENTS.md` sync rules 10 and 11

**Key Files**:

- [`schema-version.ts`](packages/shared-schema/src/schema-version.ts) — the constant and its bump warning
- [`normalize-start-of-next-day-config.ts`](src/app/features/config/normalize-start-of-next-day-config.ts) — the dual-field template
- [`global-config.reducer.ts`](src/app/features/config/store/global-config.reducer.ts) — read-time normalization at `loadAllData`
- [`db-upgrade.ts`](src/app/op-log/persistence/db-upgrade.ts) / [`db-keys.const.ts`](src/app/op-log/persistence/db-keys.const.ts) — the local-only version ladder

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- A change genuinely requires removing or renaming a synced field
- `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is raised (record what earned it)
- A desktop auto-updater ships — it changes the fleet assumption this rests on

### 9. Calendar Writes Live in Plugins, Behind Per-Provider Opt-In

**Status**: ✅ Active (recorded 2026-08; describes the boundary that shipped 2026-03 in `3e2265fa57` / `020fd56504`)

**Decision**: Super Productivity is never the authority for calendar state. It
reads calendars to show the day's commitments, and it may write a _mirror_ of a
scheduled task back — but only through a **plugin issue provider** that opts into
the `timeBlock` contract, and only when the user has enabled that provider's
auto-time-blocking setting. Core code contains no calendar write path.

The boundary today:

| Surface                                                                                            | Writes?                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Built-in iCal/CalDAV URL feeds (`src/app/features/schedule/ical/`)                                 | No — poll and parse only          |
| Built-in issue providers (`src/app/features/issue/providers/*`)                                    | No — none implement `timeBlock`   |
| Plugin providers implementing `timeBlock` (`google-calendar-provider`, `caldav-calendar-provider`) | Yes, when `isAutoTimeBlock` is on |

**Rationale**:

- **A time block is a projection, not a synced entity.** `TimeBlockSyncEffects`
  pushes task state one way — schedule, reschedule, title, estimate, done, delete
  — into an event the app itself created. It never reconciles a user's edit of
  that event back into the task, and it never touches events the app did not
  create. That keeps the flow one-directional even though it writes, which is what
  avoids the sync loop a true bidirectional design has to solve.
- **Off by default, per provider.** `isAutoTimeBlock` is an unchecked box on the
  provider's config form. Writing into someone's calendar is not something to
  infer from an integration merely being connected (manifesto: opt-in, quiet by
  default).
- **Plugins are the right home.** Every write path needs OAuth, per-vendor event
  shapes, and vendor-specific throttling. Keeping that in `packages/plugin-dev/`
  behind the `timeBlock` contract means core carries no vendor API surface, and a
  broken provider degrades to read-only rather than breaking the app.
- **What is still excluded.** No reconciliation of external event edits into task
  state, no adoption of pre-existing calendar events, and no per-occurrence
  recurring-event editing (`RECURRENCE-ID`/`EXDATE`, #8148). These are the parts
  that would require answering conflict resolution between vector clocks and
  ETags, and they remain unbuilt — see #5001 for the open bidirectional request.

**Implementation**:

- Contract: `timeBlock: { upsertEvent, deleteEvent }` in
  [`packages/plugin-api/src/issue-provider-types.ts`](packages/plugin-api/src/issue-provider-types.ts)
- Driver: [`time-block-sync.effects.ts`](src/app/features/calendar-integration/time-block/time-block-sync.effects.ts),
  registered in [`feature-stores.module.ts`](src/app/root-store/feature-stores.module.ts)
- Manual per-event actions (reschedule, delete): [`calendar-event-actions.service.ts`](src/app/features/calendar-integration/calendar-event-actions.service.ts)
- Events themselves are **not** op-log entities — a converted task is an ordinary
  task with a derived stable id
  ([`generate-calendar-task-id.ts`](src/app/features/calendar-integration/generate-calendar-task-id.ts)).
  Provider _configuration_ does sync (`ISSUE_PROVIDER` in
  [`entity-registry.ts`](src/app/op-log/core/entity-registry.ts)).

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- A core (non-plugin) calendar write path is proposed — that crosses the boundary
  this record draws
- Reconciling external event edits back into task state is proposed (#5001) — that
  needs the ETag-vs-vector-clock conflict story written down first
- Per-occurrence recurring edits land (#8148)

### 10. Vector Clocks over Server-Side Entity Versioning

**Status**: ✅ Active (recorded 2026-08; the alternative design is `git show 07511ab45c:docs/long-term-plans/server-side-entity-versioning.md`)

**Decision**: Conflict detection stays on **vector clocks**, pruned to
`MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE = 20`. Server-side per-entity version counters (optimistic
concurrency control, the shape every centralized API uses) were designed in full
and are **not being built**. The design was never rejected on its merits by a
maintainer decision — it is recorded here as declined-by-default, because nothing
has yet justified its cost.

**Rationale**:

- **The problem it solves is not observed.** Pruning only discards causal
  information once 21+ distinct client IDs have touched a clock. For a personal
  deep-work tool that is not a realistic fleet, and the one edge case that did bite
  — an import client mispruning against its own ops — is already handled by a
  same-client check.
- **It would make the server the source of truth, not just the referee.** The
  SuperSync server already detects conflicts (`detectConflict` in
  `packages/super-sync-server/src/sync/conflict.ts`), but it does so by comparing
  clocks the _clients_ authored — the causal history stays client-owned. Entity
  versioning moves that authority into the server. File-based providers (WebDAV,
  Dropbox, local file) have no server to run it, so the vector-clock path must
  survive regardless, and we would maintain **two** conflict systems instead of
  one.
- **The migration is the expensive half.** It needs a new server table, a wire
  protocol change, a backfill for every existing entity, and a mixed-fleet window
  where old (clock-only) and new (version-carrying) clients edit the same entity.
  The design did address this — each step was independently deployable and
  backward compatible — but "correct on paper, across eight steps, in the
  subsystem where mistakes silently destroy user data" is precisely the cost being
  weighed, and there is no failure it currently buys us out of.
- **Encryption boundary.** The design assumed entity versions are non-sensitive
  and would ride outside E2EE. Plausible, but it adds another plaintext channel to
  reason about and was never re-derived against the current threat model — see
  [`supersync-encryption-architecture.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/supersync-encryption-architecture.md).

**Implementation**: unchanged — see
[`docs/sync-and-op-log/vector-clocks.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/vector-clocks.md).
The server prunes after conflict detection, before storage.

**When to Update This Pattern**:

- Real fleets are observed exceeding ~20 distinct client IDs per user, or pruning
  is traced to an actual user-visible conflict (rule: start from a reproducible
  problem)
- SuperSync becomes the only supported backend, removing the "file providers need
  the clock path regardless" constraint

## Decisions Recorded Elsewhere

These carry the same authority as the numbered records above. They live outside this file because they are long enough to stand alone, or because they are enforced as contributor/agent rules that must be read before touching the subsystem. Keep this table complete — if you record a decision somewhere else, add a row here.

## How to Use This Document

### When Making Architectural Changes

1. **Before implementing**: Check if your change affects any active pattern
2. **During implementation**: Follow the documented patterns
3. **After implementation**: Update this document if you've:
   - Changed an existing pattern
   - Added a new architectural pattern
   - Made a decision that affects future development

### When to Add a New Decision

Add a new decision record when:

- The decision affects multiple files/modules
- Future developers need to understand "why" not just "what"
- The pattern needs to be followed consistently across the codebase
- The decision prevents a specific class of bugs

### When a Decision Changes

**Do not rewrite a record's rationale in place when the answer itself is reversed.** The reasoning history — why the old answer looked right, and what evidence flipped it — is the thing that stops the same idea being re-proposed a year later, and it is invisible in `git blame`. Instead:

1. Set the old record's status to `❌ Superseded by #N` and **leave it where it is**. Numbering must stay stable: ~30 code comments cite decisions by number.
2. Strip the superseded record down to **Decision** + **Rationale** — its _Implementation_ and _Key Files_ go stale the moment the code is gone — and add one line stating what new evidence or cost made it wrong.
3. Write the replacement as a new numbered decision whose rationale names the record it supersedes.

No record has been superseded yet, so there is no worked example. Decision #5 is the closest model for the _content_ of step 2 — it records a rejected design, what it actually cost (~1,565 LOC of cross-cutting machinery for a single producer), why the headline benefit was never realized, and the commit (`0893a86162`) preserving the prior implementation. It is itself `✅ Active` and does not demonstrate the status/replacement mechanics of steps 1 and 3.

This applies only when the answer changes. Fixing wording, adding a key file, or clarifying an existing decision is ordinary editing.

### Decision Record Template

```markdown
### N. [Pattern/Decision Name]

**Status**: ✅ Active | 🚧 Draft | ⚠️ Deprecated | ❌ Superseded by #N

**Decision**: [One-sentence summary of the decision]

**Rationale**:

- [Why was this decision made?]
- [What problems does it solve?]

**Implementation**:

- [How is it implemented?]
- [Key techniques or patterns used]

**Documentation**: [Link to detailed docs]

**Key Files**: [List of primary files implementing this pattern]

**When to Update This Pattern**: [Scenarios when someone should review/update this]
```

### Why One File

This log deliberately does **not** use one-file-per-decision (`docs/adr/NNNN-*.md`):

- The numbered records are one read for a contributor or an agent. Unlike the lint-enforced rules in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), a decision record's only teeth are being read — spreading them over 30 files means nobody reads all of them.
- `docs/` already separates plans, long-term-plans, research, sync-and-op-log and wiki. A further location makes decisions harder to find, not easier.

Note this is "one index, many locations", not "one file": [Decisions Recorded Elsewhere](#decisions-recorded-elsewhere) deliberately sanctions authoritative decisions living in their own documents. What stays consolidated is the **entry point**, so that ~30 in-code citations (`// See: ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md Decision #2`) resolve to one place.

Revisit when supersession chains actually accumulate, or when this file passes ~1000 lines. Then split **by subsystem**, not one file per decision, and keep the existing numbering so those citations stay valid.
