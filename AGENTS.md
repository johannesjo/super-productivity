# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository. Super Productivity is a todo and time-tracking app on Angular + Electron + Capacitor.

## Repo map

- `src/app/features/` — feature modules (tasks, planner, project, schedule, boards, …); `tasks/` is the hot core
- `src/app/root-store/` — NgRx root store; `meta/` holds the cross-entity meta-reducers
- `src/app/op-log/` — operation-log sync pipeline (capture, apply, persistence, validation)
- `src/app/pfapi/` — low-level persistence layer (model/database controllers)
- `src/app/imex/` — import/export and sync setup UI
- `src/app/core/`, `core-ui/`, `ui/` — core services and shared UI building blocks; `util/` — pure helpers
- `packages/` — workspace packages: `sync-core` + `sync-providers` (shared sync logic), `shared-schema`, `super-sync-server`, `plugin-api` + `plugin-dev`
- `electron/` — Electron main process (tests are `*.test.cjs`); `android/` + `ios/` — Capacitor shells
- `e2e/` — Playwright suite (see [`e2e/CLAUDE.md`](e2e/CLAUDE.md))

## Product principles

From the project manifesto (_Deep Work, Your Way_), kept to what changes a build decision — weigh them on every feature, and surface the leaner path when a request fights them:

- **Avoid feature creep:** prefer the smallest change that solves the real problem. New UI, settings, and sync surface are permanent costs, so extend existing building blocks before adding new ones, and let a feature ship only if it makes users _faster_, not busier. When scope outgrows the problem, propose the leaner option rather than silently building the larger one — it's still the user's call. Scope guard: this is a personal deep-work tool, not a team-management or reporting product.
- **Less noise, more depth:** reject _constant_ alerts, vanity dashboards, streaks, and dopamine loops. Opt-in reminders and notifications are core to the app, but anything attention-grabbing ships off by default and stays quiet (flow, not friction).
- **Adapt, don't impose:** people plan, track, and reflect differently, so ship new behavior as building blocks. Prefer one calm default over a new toggle; add a setting only when real workflows genuinely diverge, never to dodge a default decision (don't build it → calm default → opt-in setting).
- **Privacy & offline first:** no analytics, tracking, or telemetry (see Project rules → Privacy). Core task and time tracking must work fully offline; sync and online integrations are optional layers that degrade gracefully, never prerequisites.

## Core commands

**ALWAYS run `npm run checkFile <filepath>` on every `.ts` or `.scss` file you modify** before reporting work as done.

```bash
npm run checkFile <filepath>   # prettier + lint a single file
npm run prettier               # multi-file format
npm run lint                   # multi-file lint
npm test                       # all unit tests (Jasmine/Karma, .spec.ts co-located)
npm run test:file <filepath>   # single spec
npm run test:electron          # main-process tests — `electron/*.test.cjs`, NOT .spec.ts
                               # (tsconfig.electron.json excludes *.spec.ts, so a spec
                               #  placed under electron/ silently never runs)
npm run e2e                    # all E2E (Playwright, slow)
npm run e2e:file <path> -- --retries=0   # single E2E (~20s/test); add --grep "name" for one test
npm start                      # Electron dev
ng serve                       # web dev (or npm run startFrontend)
npm run dist                   # production build (all platforms available locally)
```

**Run the full SuperSync and WebDAV E2E suites via GitHub Actions:** manually dispatch [`E2E Tests (Scheduled)`](.github/workflows/e2e-scheduled.yml) for your branch. This should be preferred over running the full suites locally; the workflow provides dedicated WebDAV and sharded SuperSync jobs. The optional `grep` input filters the SuperSync job only.

For local SuperSync E2E (docker-compose) and the full E2E reference, see [`e2e/CLAUDE.md`](e2e/CLAUDE.md).

## Project rules

- **Translations:** UI strings go through `T` / `TranslateService`. Edit only `en.json`; never other locales.
- **Privacy:** no analytics or tracking — user data stays local unless explicitly synced.
- **Dependencies:** PRs must not add new packages to the root project's `dependencies` or `devDependencies`; use platform APIs, existing packages, or a small in-repo implementation instead. Dependencies scoped to an individual plugin are allowed when they are necessary and remain isolated to that plugin.
- **Electron:** check `IS_ELECTRON` before using Electron-specific APIs.
- **Templates:** plain HTML, minimal CSS/classes, Angular Material sparingly. See [`docs/styling-guide.md`](docs/styling-guide.md).
- **Styling review:** do not locally restyle Angular Material or shared `src/app/ui/` components for one-off context needs. This includes overriding button styles via `.mat-*`, `.mdc-*`, `button[mat-*]`, or component internals in local SCSS. Prefer existing inputs/classes/tokens; if a variant must exist, make it reusable or add it to the shared style layer.
- **Strict TypeScript:** no `any` (use `unknown` if truly unknown).
- **State:** never mutate NgRx state — return new objects in reducers. Prefer Signals to Observables.
- **Tests:** add unit tests for new services and state logic.
- **Service size cap:** no service may exceed 1200 lines (physical lines — blanks and comments count), lint-enforced via `max-lines` on `**/*.service.ts`; specs are exempt. Split by responsibility before crossing the line — extract collaborators, move pure logic to utils or `packages/` — and never grow a service past it. The pre-existing offenders grandfathered to warnings in `eslint.config.js` are debt to pay down when touched, never a license to add lines: that list may only shrink, never grow.
- **Agent-control files:** never modify `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/**`, or `.codex/**` unless the user explicitly requests it in the current task. Keep such changes isolated from product/code changes in a dedicated commit or PR, and describe how they alter future agent behavior. When adding an incident-derived rule to this file, keep it to invariant + enforcement + issue/doc pointers and move the narrative to `docs/` — this file must stay skimmable — and date any statistics you cite ("measured YYYY-MM").
- **Does it earn its place?** For a new feature, the first review question is whether it should exist at all — not whether the diff is correct. Complexity added is permanent, so the burden is on the change to justify it, and a correct, well-tested implementation of something that doesn't earn its place is still a decline. Treat the stated motivation as a claim to verify, never as context to accept → [`docs/feature-review-guide.md`](docs/feature-review-guide.md).
- **Code review:** weigh the long-term costs a change introduces — maintenance burden, hard-to-reverse choices (data shapes, public/plugin APIs, sync formats), locked-in dependencies, footguns that surface only at scale or across synced clients — not just whether the immediate diff is correct → [`docs/feature-review-guide.md`](docs/feature-review-guide.md).
- **Task component is a hot path:** every change to `src/app/features/tasks/task/task.component.*` (rendered once per task in long, scrollable lists) must be double-checked for negative performance impact — avoid function/getter calls in the template, extra change-detection work, and uncleaned subscriptions; verify against a large task list.

## Sync-correctness rules

Touched on most state-related PRs. Read the linked source/doc for full reasoning before editing. Rules 1–3 and 6 are one invariant — _one user intent = one op; replayed/remote ops must not re-trigger effects_ — fully explained in [`docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md).

**Every change to the sync system is high-risk:** a subtle bug can silently corrupt or lose user data across devices and is hard to recover from. Carefully check each change for correctness and possible failure modes (replay determinism, concurrent/remote edits, vector-clock conflicts) and call out the risks before reporting work as done.

**Judging a sync bug's severity** (before you call one low-risk): `master` ships to real users — Play internal track, Snap `edge`, and `supersync:latest` all auto-publish from every push. Never infer "shipped" from dates or the latest tag; prove it with `git tag --contains`. An unreproduced finding is not a false one. → [`docs/sync-and-op-log/sync-severity-triage.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/sync-severity-triage.md).

**Start from a reproducible problem:** any change to the sync system must begin with a reproducible failure — a failing test or scripted E2E reproduction against real data shapes (a fixture or seeded DB state), not a mocked seam. Hardening added without an observed end-to-end failure is how the sync layer accumulates overly defensive complexity; if you cannot reproduce the problem first, question the change instead of piling on guards.

1. **Effects inject `LOCAL_ACTIONS`**, never `Actions` (`ALL_ACTIONS` only for the op-log capture effect; remote archive side effects → `ArchiveOperationHandler`, not `ALL_ACTIONS`). Lint-enforced (`no-actions-in-effects`). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `src/app/util/local-actions.token.ts`.
2. **Prefer action-based effects**; a selector-based effect needs `skipDuringSyncWindow()`. Lint-enforced (`require-hydration-guard`). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md).
3. **Multi-entity change = meta-reducer**, not an effect fan-out (one reducer pass = one op). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/`.
4. **Logical clock:** route "what day is this?" through `DateService` (`getLogicalTodayDate`, `isToday`, `todayStr`). Pure reducers/selectors take `startOfNextDayDiffMs` as an arg and call `isTodayWithOffset` for replay determinism. The raw `DateService.startOfNextDayDiff` is `private`; use `getStartOfNextDayDiffMs()` at service boundaries.
5. **`TODAY_TAG` (`'TODAY'`) is virtual** — never add to `task.tagIds`; membership comes from `task.dueWithTime` or `task.dueDay`. `TODAY_TAG.taskIds` only stores ordering. → `ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` Decision #2.
6. **Bulk dispatch loop:** `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 0))` after the loop (else 50+ rapid dispatches lose state). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `OperationApplierService.applyOperations()`.
7. **`SYNC_IMPORT` / `BACKUP_IMPORT`** replace state and intentionally drop concurrent ops (CONCURRENT or LESS_THAN by vector clock) — by design, not a bug. → `SyncImportFilterService`.
8. **Vector clocks:** `MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE = 20`. Server prunes after conflict detection, before storage. → `docs/sync-and-op-log/vector-clocks.md`.
9. **Logging:** `Log.log({ id: task.id })`, never `Log.log(task)` or `Log.log(title)` — log history is exportable, never log user content.
10. **A schema bump never protects the released fleet, is near-irreversible, and is not free even when safe — default to NOT bumping `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.** New op semantics MUST degrade gracefully on older clients (`LwwUpdatePayload` envelope / inert-marker pattern). A change old clients would misapply must not ship behind a bump alone; a change they can tolerate must not ship behind a bump at all. → `packages/shared-schema/src/schema-version.ts`, normative policy in [operation-log-architecture.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/operation-log-architecture.md) §A.7.11 "Bump Policy".
11. **A new REQUIRED field on a persisted model breaks every existing install — type it optional (`?`) plus a runtime default.** Data already on users' disks lacks the field and typia rejects it on hydration; TypeScript guards only _new_ data, so the build goes green while every existing install fails validation, and the failure stays latent until an unrelated bump drags old data onto the migration path. **Do not assume a heal exists.** Guarded by `src/app/op-log/validation/frozen-state.spec.ts` — if it fails, fix the model, never the fixture. → full analysis: [persisted-model-fields.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/persisted-model-fields.md), #9125, #9124.
