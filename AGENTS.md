# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository. Super Productivity is a todo and time-tracking app on Angular + Electron + Capacitor.

## Product principles

From the project manifesto (_Deep Work, Your Way_), kept to what changes a build decision — weigh them on every feature, and surface the leaner path when a request fights them:

- **Avoid feature creep:** prefer the smallest change that solves the real problem. New UI, settings, and sync surface are permanent costs, so extend existing building blocks before adding new ones, and let a feature ship only if it makes users _faster_, not busier. When scope outgrows the problem, propose the leaner option rather than silently building the larger one — it's still the user's call. Scope guard: this is a personal deep-work tool, not a team-management or reporting product.
- **Less noise, more depth:** reject _constant_ alerts, vanity dashboards, streaks, and dopamine loops. Opt-in reminders and notifications are core to the app, but anything attention-grabbing ships off by default and stays quiet (flow, not friction).
- **Adapt, don't impose:** people plan, track, and reflect differently, so ship new behavior as building blocks. Prefer one calm default over a new toggle; add a setting only when real workflows genuinely diverge, never to dodge a default decision (don't build it → calm default → opt-in setting).
- **Privacy & offline first:** no analytics, tracking, or telemetry (see Project rules → Privacy). Core task and time tracking must work fully offline; sync and online integrations are optional layers that degrade gracefully, never prerequisites.

## Core commands

**ALWAYS run `npm run checkFile <filepath>` on every `.ts` or `.scss` file you modify** before reporting work as done.

```bash
npm run checkFile <filepath>   # prettier + lint a single file
npm run prettier               # multi-file format
npm run lint                   # multi-file lint
npm test                       # all unit tests (Jasmine/Karma, .spec.ts co-located)
npm run test:file <filepath>   # single spec
npm run test:electron          # main-process tests — `electron/*.test.cjs`, NOT .spec.ts
                               # (tsconfig.electron.json excludes *.spec.ts, so a spec
                               #  placed under electron/ silently never runs)
npm run e2e                    # all E2E (Playwright, slow)
npm run e2e:file <path> -- --retries=0   # single E2E (~20s/test); add --grep "name" for one test
npm start                      # Electron dev
ng serve                       # web dev (or npm run startFrontend)
npm run dist                   # production build (all platforms available locally)
```

**Run the full SuperSync and WebDAV E2E suites via GitHub Actions:** manually dispatch [`E2E Tests (Scheduled)`](.github/workflows/e2e-scheduled.yml) for your branch. This should be preferred over running the full suites locally; the workflow provides dedicated WebDAV and sharded SuperSync jobs. The optional `grep` input filters the SuperSync job only.

For local SuperSync E2E (docker-compose) and the full E2E reference, see [`e2e/CLAUDE.md`](e2e/CLAUDE.md).

## Project rules

- **Translations:** UI strings go through `T` / `TranslateService`. Edit only `en.json`; never other locales.
- **Privacy:** no analytics or tracking — user data stays local unless explicitly synced.
- **Dependencies:** PRs must not add new packages to the root project's `dependencies` or `devDependencies`; use platform APIs, existing packages, or a small in-repo implementation instead. Dependencies scoped to an individual plugin are allowed when they are necessary and remain isolated to that plugin.
- **Electron:** check `IS_ELECTRON` before using Electron-specific APIs.
- **Templates:** plain HTML, minimal CSS/classes, Angular Material sparingly. See [`docs/styling-guide.md`](docs/styling-guide.md).
- **Styling review:** do not locally restyle Angular Material or shared `src/app/ui/` components for one-off context needs. This includes overriding button styles via `.mat-*`, `.mdc-*`, `button[mat-*]`, or component internals in local SCSS. Prefer existing inputs/classes/tokens; if a variant must exist, make it reusable or add it to the shared style layer.
- **Strict TypeScript:** no `any` (use `unknown` if truly unknown).
- **State:** never mutate NgRx state — return new objects in reducers. Prefer Signals to Observables.
- **Tests:** add unit tests for new services and state logic.
- **Service size cap:** no service may exceed 1200 lines (physical lines — blanks and comments count), lint-enforced via `max-lines` on `**/*.service.ts`; specs are exempt. Split by responsibility before crossing the line — extract collaborators, move pure logic to utils or `packages/` — and never grow a service past it. A new service over the cap fails lint. The pre-existing offenders (sync/op-log/plugin/task services) are grandfathered to warnings in `eslint.config.js`: that list may only shrink — never add to it — and they are debt to pay down when touched, not a precedent to extend.
- **Agent-control files:** never modify `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/**`, or `.codex/**` unless the user explicitly requests it in the current task. Keep such changes isolated from product/code changes in a dedicated commit or PR, and describe how they alter future agent behavior.
- **Does it earn its place?** For a new feature, the first review question is whether it should exist at all — not whether the diff is correct. Complexity added is permanent, so the burden is on the change to justify it. Is there real demand (reactions and distinct participants on the linked issue, not just the author)? Has the same idea been declined before — search **closed** issues, because a prior "no" needs new evidence, not a new PR. Does the PR's stated motivation survive checking: are the issues it cites actually open, or already fixed more cheaply (`git log -S`, `git tag --contains`)? Treat the motivation as a claim to verify, not context to accept. A correct, well-tested implementation of something that doesn't earn its place is still a decline, and the leanest fix that resolves the reported symptom usually wins.
- **Code review:** when reviewing new features, always double-check the potential long-term costs and risks a change introduces — maintenance burden, hard-to-reverse choices (data shapes, public/plugin APIs, sync formats), locked-in dependencies/abstractions, and footguns that only surface at scale or across synced clients — not just whether the immediate diff is correct.
- **Task component is a hot path:** every change to `src/app/features/tasks/task/task.component.*` (rendered once per task in long, scrollable lists) must be double-checked for negative performance impact — avoid function/getter calls in the template, extra change-detection work, and uncleaned subscriptions; verify against a large task list.

## Sync-correctness rules

Touched on most state-related PRs. Read the linked source/doc for full reasoning before editing. Rules 1–3 and 6 are one invariant — _one user intent = one op; replayed/remote ops must not re-trigger effects_ — fully explained in [`docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md`](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md).

**Every change to the sync system is high-risk:** a subtle bug can silently corrupt or lose user data across devices and is hard to recover from. Carefully check each change for correctness and possible failure modes (replay determinism, concurrent/remote edits, vector-clock conflicts) and call out the risks before reporting work as done.

**Start from a reproducible problem:** any change to the sync system must begin with a reproducible failure — a failing test or scripted E2E reproduction against real data shapes (a fixture or seeded DB state), not a mocked seam. Hardening added without an observed end-to-end failure is how the sync layer accumulates overly defensive complexity; if you cannot reproduce the problem first, question the change instead of piling on guards.

1. **Effects inject `LOCAL_ACTIONS`**, never `Actions` (`ALL_ACTIONS` only for the op-log capture effect; remote archive side effects → `ArchiveOperationHandler`, not `ALL_ACTIONS`). Lint-enforced (`no-actions-in-effects`). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `src/app/util/local-actions.token.ts`.
2. **Prefer action-based effects**; a selector-based effect needs `skipDuringSyncWindow()`. Lint-enforced (`require-hydration-guard`). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md).
3. **Multi-entity change = meta-reducer**, not an effect fan-out (one reducer pass = one op). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `src/app/root-store/meta/task-shared-meta-reducers/`.
4. **Logical clock:** route "what day is this?" through `DateService` (`getLogicalTodayDate`, `isToday`, `todayStr`). Pure reducers/selectors take `startOfNextDayDiffMs` as an arg and call `isTodayWithOffset` for replay determinism. The raw `DateService.startOfNextDayDiff` is `private`; use `getStartOfNextDayDiffMs()` at service boundaries.
5. **`TODAY_TAG` (`'TODAY'`) is virtual** — never add to `task.tagIds`; membership comes from `task.dueWithTime` or `task.dueDay`. `TODAY_TAG.taskIds` only stores ordering. → `ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md` Decision #2.
6. **Bulk dispatch loop:** `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 0))` after the loop (else 50+ rapid dispatches lose state). → [contributor-sync-model.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/contributor-sync-model.md), `OperationApplierService.applyOperations()`.
7. **`SYNC_IMPORT` / `BACKUP_IMPORT`** replace state and intentionally drop concurrent ops (CONCURRENT or LESS_THAN by vector clock) — by design, not a bug. → `SyncImportFilterService`.
8. **Vector clocks:** `MAX_VECTOR_CLOCK_SIZE = 20`. Server prunes after conflict detection, before storage. → `docs/sync-and-op-log/vector-clocks.md`.
9. **Logging:** `Log.log({ id: task.id })`, never `Log.log(task)` or `Log.log(title)` — log history is exportable, never log user content.
10. **A schema bump never protects the released fleet — and is near-irreversible, so default to NOT bumping `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.** v17.0.0–v18.14.0 clients apply ops up to schema 5 UNMIGRATED (their old `+3` skip band) and, at schema ≥ 6, block them but still advance the server cursor — those ops are skipped permanently, even after updating. Only post-v18.14.0 receivers block newer ops safely. So new op semantics MUST degrade gracefully on older clients (`LwwUpdatePayload` envelope pattern); a change old clients would misapply must not ship behind a bump alone. And a change old clients can TOLERATE must not ship behind a bump at all: a bump hard-blocks every lagging post-v18.14.0 client (frozen cursor), can't be reverted once ops carry the version, and buys nothing a payload marker/envelope wouldn't (v4/#9009 delete-wins was bumped for a marker-only change that didn't need it — the mistake to avoid). → `packages/shared-schema/src/schema-version.ts`, [operation-log-architecture.md](docs/sync-and-op-log/operation-log-architecture.md) §A.7.11 "Bump Policy".
11. **A new REQUIRED field on a persisted model breaks every existing install — type it optional (`?`).** Data already on users' disks lacks it and typia rejects it. Prefer `?` plus a runtime default; a backfill migration is the exception, because it costs a schema bump (rule 10). TypeScript guards only _new_ data: it errors until you add the field to `DEFAULT_*`, then compiles clean while every existing install still fails validation. **Do not assume a heal exists** — `loadAllData` merges per-section defaults for only 9 of the 21 `globalConfig` sections (`global-config.reducer.ts`; the rest are a top-level spread, so a stored section wins wholesale), entity slices get only the generic coercions in `auto-fix-typia-errors.ts` (missing boolean → `false`, nullable → `null`), and that file's blanket `globalConfig.*` default runs only inside the user-facing `dataRepair` flow, not normal hydration. A per-type heal needs its own branch in `auto-fix-typia-errors.ts` — **not** `recreate-fallback.const.ts`, where membership also opts the type into SPAP-14 disjoint-field auto-merge. The failure is latent: hydration trusts a snapshot whose schema version matches, so it surfaces only when an unrelated bump drags it onto the migration path (#8965 shipped in January, detonated in v18.15.0 as a boot-to-empty-store). Guarded by `src/app/op-log/validation/frozen-state.spec.ts` — if it fails, fix the model, never the fixture. → #9125, #9124.

## Judging sync severity

Rules for triage — how to decide whether a sync bug is real and how bad it is. Each one below is
here because getting it wrong already produced a confidently wrong conclusion.

1. **`master` ships to real users. "It's only on master" never downgrades severity.** Every master
   push auto-publishes to the Play **internal track** (`.github/workflows/build-android.yml`,
   `tracks: internal` + `status: completed` → testers' phones auto-update within minutes, on their
   real data). `ghcr.io/super-productivity/supersync:latest` **is** master and has no
   release-tagged build at all — it is the default in `packages/super-sync-server/docker-compose.yml`,
   so self-hosters on `docker compose pull` run master HEAD. Snap `edge` is also published from
   every master push. Only desktop/web/F-Droid/Play-production/Snap-stable are release-gated.
2. **Never infer "shipped" from dates or the latest tag — prove it.** Use
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit> v<tag>` / `git tag --contains <commit>`. Tags are cut from
   a point in time, and sync features routinely land just after: **#8874's disjoint-field merge
   landed ~24h after v18.14.0 was tagged and is in no release**, so whole-entity-LWW field loss
   (rename dies when another device marks the task done, #9095) is live in **every shipped version**.
3. **"Restores released behavior" ≠ safe. The released behavior can be the bug.** #9061 froze the
   disjoint merge on exactly that reasoning and silently re-armed shipped data loss (#9095).
   A freeze/revert needs the same "what breaks for users?" analysis as a feature.
4. **Users do report sync bugs — in non-technical words. There is no `sync` label.** Keyword-grepping
   `sync`/`op-log`/`conflict` undercounts by ~50×. Search what users actually write: _lost,
   disappeared, gone, missing, duplicate, reverted, old version, overwritten, reset, not syncing_
   (#7892 "all data deleted overnight"; #8107 user rebuilt lost projects from memory; #7549 done
   tasks resurrecting). ~53 user-reported sync/data-loss issues from 44 authors in 90 days ≈ one
   every 2 days. And silent data loss is structurally under-reported — absence of reports is never
   evidence of absence.
5. **Audit-generated findings are low-precision, not low-yield — verify them, don't dismiss them.**
   ~89% of sync fixes since v18.14.0 repaired code present in the release, yet ~97% of the self-filed
   sync issues carried no reproduction. So both failure modes are live: **do not close an unreproduced
   finding as speculation** (#8960/#9073/#8751/#9040 had no repro and were all real and shipped), and
   **do not fix one blind** — the _fix_ must carry a test that fails without it, and you must confirm
   the fix actually fires on a real op (#9045 shipped an `entityIds` security check that **never fired**;
   #9025 was self-retracted as "not a live data-loss bug"). The reproduction gates the _fix_, not belief.
