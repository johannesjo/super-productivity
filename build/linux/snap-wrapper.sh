# Pre-Electron argv wrapper for Super Productivity on Linux.
#
# Forces --ozone-platform=x11 when launched inside *our* Snap sandbox on a
# Wayland session. This is load-bearing: the programmatic
# app.commandLine.appendSwitch('ozone-platform','x11') in electron/start-app.ts
# is not enough in practice — field reports on issue #7270 show Chromium's
# Ozone init dlopens libEGL/libgbm on the core22 Mesa path before
# appendSwitch is honored, which segfaults under host-vs-snap Mesa ABI
# drift. Putting the flag into argv before Electron's argv parser runs
# bypasses that.
#
# Same mechanism used by Signal Desktop and Mattermost Desktop snaps
# (snapcrafters/signal-desktop, snapcrafters/mattermost-desktop).
#
# All Linux launches pass through this wrapper, but only our Snap on Wayland
# receives the extra ozone flag; every other launch is a plain exec. The
# SNAP_NAME gate protects .deb/.rpm installs invoked via xdg-open from *another*
# snap (where $SNAP leaks into the child env).
#
# This wrapper deliberately does NOT pass --class: Electron ignores that switch.
# See tools/verify-linux-wm-class.test.js and #9674.
#
# See docs/research/snap-wayland-gpu-fix-research.md §18.

# Derive the real ELF path. Inside our snap confinement, $SNAP is the
# revision mount root and is more reliable than $0 resolution through
# snapd's wrapper chain. Elsewhere, resolve $0 through symlinks — this
# handles /usr/bin/superproductivity symlinks from .deb/.rpm installs.
