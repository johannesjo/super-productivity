# Sync Simplification Plan

**Status:** Re-aligned to `origin/master` 7ef7e69e96 on 2026-07-16. The 2026-07-15 re-align (baseline 6fefd741c5) covered 15 commits of sync fixes landing in/around every task surface — #9023 (REPAIR concurrency guard) and #9040 (immutable split snapshots) in Task 2's adapter, #9028 (WS local-win re-upload) in Task 4's shell, #9045 (decrypt-path footprint auth + journal privacy), #9048 (notes/sections/repeat-cfg cascade recovery) and #9035 (clientId LWW tiebreak) in Task 6's territory, #9026 (non-interactive in-lock repair) in the critical section. Master has since advanced 3 further commits, of which exactly one touches a task surface: **#9054** (authenticated LWW project-move footprint, GHSA-8pxh-mgc7-gp3g) lands in `conflict-resolution.service.ts` and is folded into contract 14 and §4's fence list below. The other two are out of scope (#9052 orphan-task navigation heal, #9056 locale date names). Claims below verified against `origin/master`; #9044 was dialog-layer only and did not touch the file adapter. **Revised 2026-07-17:** Task 6 rescoped — the disjoint-field merge is load-bearing against whole-entity LWW data loss (#9095, producer unfrozen in #9101) and is now excluded from the rollback; the rollback covers the conflict journal and review UI only. Journal removal ≠ merge removal.

**Date:** 2026-07-16

**Baseline commit:** 7ef7e69e96 (previous audit baselines: 6fefd741c5, 7e273a0e5c)

**Scope:** Conflict-review behavior, file-provider target state, and duplicate SuperSync trigger pipelines

## 1. Outcome

Delete sync lifecycle policy only where a smaller path preserves persisted-data compatibility, provider eligibility, and notification delivery.

The smallest safe order is:

1. audit builds that received the conflict-review feature and freeze the schema-v3/v4 compatibility boundary;
2. fix file-provider state crossing remote-target changes;
3. add one background full-sync scheduler that cooperates with every existing full-sync owner;
4. route SuperSync WebSocket and eligible local-operation triggers through it;
5. delete the duplicated partial download/upload pipelines only after focused behavior and request-cost gates pass;
6. remove only the conflict-review producers and UI that the deployment/persisted-data audit proves disposable;
7. correct current sync documentation after behavior settles.

**Timing constraint:** the conflict-review feature (962c5bbeb1, merged 2026-07-11) is on master but in no release tag, and releases ship every one to two weeks. The journal half of the producer freeze is already in place on master (`disableConflictJournal: true` at the production entry point in `RemoteOpsProcessingService`), so stable releases do not expand the persisted-data obligation. The disjoint-merge half of the original #9061 freeze was deliberately reverted by #9101 and MUST NOT be re-applied: with the merge disabled, concurrent edits to different fields of one entity resolve by whole-entity LWW and the earlier side's edit is silently and permanently lost on every client (#9095 — live in every release up to v18.14.0). The merge producer ships enabled; only the journal stays frozen for stable.

Atomic browser startup and replacement of flag-and-poll maintenance exclusion remain worthwhile correctness projects, but they are not prerequisites for deleting the two partial SuperSync pipelines. Keeping them separate avoids turning a bounded simplification into a cross-tab/bootstrap and every-import-owner rewrite.

The previous broad “remove roughly 6,000 lines together” decision is rejected. Schema-v3 replace/patch compatibility, schema-v4 delete-wins behavior, and multi-entity recovery follow-ups now share that area. Compatibility readers and unrelated data-loss fixes must be fenced explicitly. Post-baseline fixes to fence here include #9048 (notes/sections/repeat-cfg cascade recovery), #9035 (deterministic clientId LWW tiebreak in `@sp/sync-core`), #9025 (invalid-LWW-projectId sanitization in the LWW/section reducers), #9045 (decrypt-path project-move footprint authentication + journal privacy fail-safe), and #9054 (authenticated project-move footprint re-derivation inside `conflict-resolution.service.ts` — see contract 14; this one is security-critical and sits directly in Task 6's deletion path).

## 3. Contracts that every slice preserves

1. One user intent creates one durable operation. Remote or replayed operations do not re-trigger local effects.
2. Remote operations are durable before reducer application. Apply status, vector-clock merge, archive completion, and downloaded cursor retain crash-safe ordering.
3. Resume/visibility suppression opens synchronously before debounce or lock acquisition.
4. One validation session owns nested download, piggyback, conflict, and apply work. No caller publishes IN_SYNC before classification.
5. Normal and compensation operations retain full client clocks until server comparison. Approved bounded pruning remains capped at 20 clients.
6. A receiver stops at the first unsupported, newer, invalid, or migration-failing operation and advances only through the valid prefix.
7. Schema-v3 replace-mode and patch-mode LWW operations remain distinguishable and replayable. Schema-v4 marked project deletions retain delete-wins semantics; historical unmarked deletions retain timestamp LWW. Both migration barriers and the IndexedDB downgrade barrier remain.
8. A file snapshot's state cache, archives, vector clock, and snapshot-included operations commit as one baseline. A failed commit leaves the previous baseline intact. The committed ops file's snapshot is written to an immutable, generation-unique file (`snapshotRef.file`, `sync-state__<syncVersion>__<random>.json`) a concurrent compactor cannot clobber; the fixed `sync-state.json`/`.bak` remain a pre-#9040 compat fallback. A confirmed rev mismatch reclaims the orphaned immutable snapshot, but an ambiguous commit failure must not delete it (#9040).
9. Split-file operations newer than the referenced snapshot (resolved `snapshotRef.file` → `sync-state.json` → `.bak`, #9040) apply normally before the downloaded cursor advances.
10. Persistent local actions arriving during snapshot hydration are deferred, durably restored on top of the new baseline, replayed into live state, and have archive side effects restored before the remote-apply window closes.
11. Archive read-modify-write operations and remote/import replacements serialize through the `TASK_ARCHIVE` boundary. (Known residual: `TimeTrackingService` project/tag cleanup runs outside this mutex — #8941; do not treat that gap as resolved.)
12. Raw rebuild resumes before ordinary sync; reducer-pending work blocks sync.
13. Import/rebuild retain preflight-before-mutation, backup, atomic replacement, cursor, and crash-resume ordering.
14. Encryption fails closed. `isPayloadEncrypted` is not a trusted policy input (enforced at the download boundary). On the decrypt path an encrypted LWW op's `entityId` (bound to authenticated `payload.id`) and, when the payload carries `projectMoveSubTaskIds`, its multi-task project-move footprint `entityIds` (bound to `{entityId} ∪ projectMoveSubTaskIds`) are validated against the GCM-authenticated payload and rejected on mismatch (`verify-decrypted-op-integrity.ts`, #9045). Synthetic conflict-resolution LWW ops (carrying `entityIds` without an authenticated `projectMoveSubTaskIds`) are intentionally exempt from that check; that exemption must survive the Task 6 rollback (the disjoint merge itself now stays). The exemption is safe only because no relocation decision ever reads a plaintext envelope (#9054, GHSA-8pxh-mgc7-gp3g): `getTaskProjectMoveEntityIds` (`conflict-resolution.service.ts`) re-derives a footprint from the authenticated `payload.projectMoveFootprint` for LWW ops, and for raw `TASK_SHARED_UPDATE` ops from `actionPayload.projectMoveSubTaskIds` plus a root of `actionPayload.task.id` — never `op.entityId`/`op.entityIds` — so a tampered remote envelope cannot be laundered into the freshly-authenticated merged op. That single choke point serves the disjoint-merge, local-win, and superseded-op callers, and both LWW-TASK reducers consume only `meta.projectMoveFootprint` (via `parseMoveFootprint`), with footprint-less legacy ops falling back to receiving-state repair. **Task 6 must keep this choke point intact and must not reintroduce an `op.entityIds` read** — doing so reopens the vector one merge removed. Ops minted in conflict resolution deliberately write the footprint to both `payload.projectMoveFootprint` and `op.entityIds` (the server needs plaintext ids for its indexed conflict detection and cannot read the ciphertext). The surviving envelope `entityIds` readers (`bulk-archive-filter.util.ts`, `get-op-entity-ids.util.ts`) are suppression-only, not relocation, and remain pending the durable AAD hardening.
15. File revisions, expected sync versions, and vector-clock baselines remain staged until durable apply and cursor commit. Delete-all ordering across split, tombstone, and backup artifacts remains. Known residual: `_deleteAllData` does not enumerate/remove `STATE_GEN_FILE_PREFIX` immutable snapshots (no `listFiles`; `listFiles`-prune is the documented backstop) — the Task 2 reset helper must account for this remote-file gap.
16. Pending local writes flush before the conflict frontier is read. Conflict planning/execution remain inside the operation-log critical section. In-lock validation/repair runs non-interactively — no native `confirm()`/`alert()` blocks the `sp_op_log` critical section during background sync (#9026); only the pre-lock, foreground USE_REMOTE recovery opts into interactive dialogs.
17. SuperSync conflict prefetch and per-user lastSeq reservation stay in one transaction; clean-slate replacement preserves monotonic lastSeq.
18. Piggybacked operations apply before corresponding local entries are marked synced.
19. A compatibility reader is deleted only after its explicit support condition is true.
20. A whole-entity LWW exact-timestamp tie breaks deterministically by larger `clientId` so both devices converge, routing the local tie-win through the existing `localWinOperationKind: 'update'` path (`@sp/sync-core`, #9035). That path (including its delete-recreation branch) stays intact.

## 4. Success criteria

- [ ] Schema-v3 replace/patch operations and schema-v4 marked/unmarked project deletions retain their distinct semantics through every supported persisted path.
- [ ] Target-A operations cannot read, upload, delete, back up, or repopulate state for target B, including after restart.
- [ ] A background request arriving during foreground, initial, background, or maintenance work is retained and drained by exactly one pending owner after initial-sync and request-time provider/configuration eligibility are revalidated.
- [ ] WebSocket delivery retains a sequence high-watermark, bounded transient retry, cursor-based completion, and terminal authentication behavior.
- [ ] Persisted local operations request full sync only under the current non-file operation-sync provider policy.
- [ ] File providers receive no new automatic I/O.
- [ ] A SuperSync-only request queued before a provider, account, or configuration transition cannot drain against the new target.
- [ ] File snapshot baseline atomicity, post-snapshot suffix ordering, concurrent-compaction / immutable-snapshot resolution (#9040), hydration-time local edits, and archive serialization retain their focused regression coverage.
- [ ] The partial WebSocket download pipeline and ImmediateUploadService disappear only after focused replacement tests and the request-cost gate pass.
- [ ] Conflict-review producers/UI disappear only to the extent authorized by the deployed-build and persisted-data audit.
- [ ] The conflict-journal producer stays frozen for stable releases until the rollback decision; the disjoint-merge producer stays ENABLED — disabling it re-introduces #9095 data loss (see Task 6).
- [ ] No public provider protocol, server contract, persistence repository layer, cross-tab lease, or general error taxonomy is introduced.
- [ ] Each deletion slice removes more production state/policy than its replacement adds.

Line count is evidence, not the goal. A phase succeeds only when it removes behavioral states and failure paths without removing a required reader or guarantee.

## 5. Non-goals

- A new sync-engine package or host-port abstraction.
- CRDTs, timestamp last-write-wins, or full-state-only sync.
- New operation strings, schema versions, encryption envelopes, or server exchanges.
- An acknowledgement-only upload protocol.
- A universal queue with foreground result waiters or presentation state.
- More aggressive file-provider auto-sync.
- A cross-tab lease, owner heartbeat, or generation protocol.
- Failing closed for core offline import/profile workflows merely because Web Locks are unavailable.
- Splitting ConflictResolutionService only to reduce file length.
- Characterization tests that bless a known divergence.

If a task requires one of these, stop and write a separate behavior proposal with migration and rollback analysis.

## 6. Phase 0 — Establish the compatibility and provider boundary

### Task 1: Audit deployed builds and persisted conflict data

**Size:** Small audit; blocks conflict-feature deletion

Record:

- every distribution channel containing commits at or after 962c5bbeb1, including master edge artifacts, Android internal builds, and previews;
- the stable baseline: v18.14.0 ships schema v2 and operation-log DB version 7; current master is schema v4 and DB version 10, with both the v2-to-v3 replace/patch barrier and the v3-to-v4 marked-project-delete barrier unreleased. Unless reverted before the next tag, schema v3 compatibility, schema v4 delete-wins behavior, and the conflict-review feature reach stable together;
- whether those cohorts are supported/dogfood-only and what persisted-data promise applies;
- the representations supported cohorts can create: schema-v3 replace/patch operations and schema-v4 marked project deletions in IndexedDB, file providers, backups, or SuperSync, plus historical unmarked deletions and the device-local conflict journal;
- the retention/export/deletion decision for journal rows containing discarded values, and the associated `SUP_CONFLICT_JOURNAL_CLEARED_BEFORE` localStorage clear-marker the journal reader now writes as a cross-profile privacy fail-safe (#9045) — it must be removed with the store, not stranded.

Only after the cohort audit, add or retain persisted fixtures for representations reachable by supported builds. The audit may authorize removal of writers; it cannot authorize schema downgrade or reader removal while supported stored data remains possible.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] The master baseline is schema v4/DB 10, not v3; the audit records that the deployed stable fleet stays v2/DB 7 until the next tag.
- [ ] The producer-freeze-before-next-release decision (see Outcome) is made explicitly.
- [ ] Supported and unsupported cohorts are an explicit product decision, not inferred from release tags.
- [ ] Journal rows have a documented read/export/expiry or deletion policy.
- [ ] Replace/patch fixtures and marked/unmarked project-delete fixtures cover each persisted path the supported-cohort audit proves reachable.
- [ ] Ordinary multi-entity recovery, project-delete cascade recovery including notes/sections/task-repeat-cfg recreation and its cross-batch convergence (#9048), exact-timestamp clientId tiebreak convergence (#9035), invalid-LWW-projectId sanitization (#9025), live-versus-hydration, and transaction-rollback coverage is retained.

**Stop condition:** Do not begin conflict-feature deletion while a deployed cohort or persisted representation is unknown. Preserve the reader/UI needed to recover supported data.

### Task 2: Isolate file-provider state across target changes

**Size:** Medium correctness fix

Start with a failing test where target A has I/O in flight, configuration switches to B, and A would otherwise perform a later remote side effect using reloaded B configuration. Also recreate the adapter after the switch/crash to expose stale persisted provider-ID state. Before implementing, inventory every authoritative mutation ingress: ProviderManager saves, direct provider credential writes, OAuth account re-authentication, Electron LocalFile selection, and Android SAF selection. Machine-only access-token refresh for an unchanged account is not a target transition.

Use the smallest conservative design:

1. serialize a file sync session and every authoritative target/configuration mutation behind one narrow target-transition boundary;
2. bind the session to one immutable provider/configuration snapshot;
3. increment one adapter-wide generation on any user-authoritative file-provider configuration save, account change, or LocalFile folder change;
4. clear all in-memory and persisted target-scoped revision, cursor, corruption, staged-baseline, and cache state through one helper;
5. validate the generation before every remote upload, delete, or backup side effect;
6. force discovery/full read after any user-authoritative configuration save.

Accept the extra full read even when the target is unchanged. Do not add stable target identities unless later profiling proves the optimization worthwhile. Never put credentials, keys, or raw secret-bearing URLs in an identity, log, or cache key; SuperSync's target-keyed cursor hashes baseUrl plus access token and must not be copied.

Five verified constraints on the design:

- The generation bump must also fire from the Electron LocalFile picker success callback and Android `setupSaf()`: both mutate the target outside ProviderManager, and since #8228 the Electron folder lives main-side rather than in privateCfg.
- "Any user-authoritative configuration save" includes encryption, compression, and interval toggles; each forces a full-file re-download, and a forced from-zero read with pending local operations can surface the whole-file conflict dialog. Accept and test this consequence; narrow the invalidation to identity-affecting fields only if it proves painful in practice. #9044 already isolated provider encryption settings at the dialog layer (`dialog-sync-cfg.component.ts`: reset on provider change, a `_providerConfigLoadId` stale-load guard, encryption re-derived from the selected provider's privateCfg behind `_waitForCurrentProviderConfig()` at the save boundary). Wire the adapter generation-bump and forced re-read into that same save boundary; do not duplicate `_providerConfigLoadId` or add a third counter.
- Extract and extend the existing delete-all reset into one helper used by both deletion and target transition. The helper must cover expected and pending expected sync versions, last-seen and pending vector clocks, local sequence/cursor state, last recovered-corrupt revision, last-seen and pending file revisions, both within-cycle caches, and persisted entries. In current code the delete-all block already clears every one of these except the last recovered-corrupt revision (`_lastRecoveredCorruptRev`), so the extraction's value is the shared call site at the target-transition boundary, not a large missing field set — the actual in-memory gap is a single `.delete(providerKey)`. #9023 and #9040 added no new in-memory target-scoped field. (Remote-file gap, separate: #9040's `STATE_GEN_FILE_PREFIX` immutable snapshots are not enumerated by `_deleteAllData` — see contract 15; out of scope for the in-memory helper, but do not regress fixed-name delete ordering.)
- Since #9023, the REPAIR path adds generation-validated side-effect sites beyond the first upload: the rev-based conditional REPAIR-snapshot write (`_conditionalUploadRepairSnapshot`), the split `getFileRev` pre-check and write, and — critically — the `rebaseStaleRepair` retry loop (`RejectedOpsHandlerService`) that downloads concurrent ops and re-uploads a rebuilt repair after a `REPAIR_STALE` reject. Validate the generation across the whole rebase retry, not just the leading write, so a mid-rebase target switch cannot download from A and re-upload to B. The rev guard (same-target concurrency) and the generation guard (wrong-target) are complementary; clearing `_lastSeenRevs` on transition degrades the conditional write to a safe expect-absent write, not a stale-rev overwrite.
- `providerConfigChanged$` is one trigger source, not the boundary. OneDrive settings and platform folder pickers currently have direct writes, while automatic token refreshes must remain generation-neutral when the account and target are unchanged.

Cover one normal configuration-driven provider, OneDrive's direct settings write, Electron LocalFile's picker, and Android SAF selection. Also cover an OAuth re-authentication to a different account (Dropbox/OneDrive keep the same provider ID), an unchanged-account token refresh that must not invalidate, staged expected-version/vector-clock/revision promotion, corruption-notice state, and the within-cycle download cache, which can otherwise embed target A's snapshot in a file written to target B. Add a case where the target switches mid-REPAIR-rebase (after `REPAIR_STALE`, within `rebaseStaleRepair`) and assert no upload/download crosses to the new target. The common adapter path should cover other file providers without a full provider-specific matrix.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] A late A operation performs no upload/delete/backup against B and cannot repopulate B state.
- [ ] Restart cannot reload A revision/cursor/cache state under B's provider ID.
- [ ] Normal configuration changes, OneDrive direct settings writes, Electron LocalFile picker changes, and Android SAF changes invalidate authoritatively.
- [ ] An account switch behind an unchanged provider ID invalidates like a target change.
- [ ] A machine-only token refresh for the same account does not force a target reset.
- [ ] The within-cycle cache cannot carry target-A data into a target-B write.
- [ ] Every user-authoritative configuration save forces safe discovery/full read.
- [ ] Split migration, conditional-write protection (including #9023's REPAIR rev-based guard and the `REPAIR_STALE`→`rebaseStaleRepair` rebase, and #9040's immutable-snapshot write plus its commit-point GC), tombstones, staged expected-version/vector-clock/revision promotion, backup recovery, and fixed-name delete ordering remain unchanged; the generation guard must not wedge the REPAIR rebase-retry convergence.

**Verification:** Run the focused adapter/provider/configuration tests and npm run checkFile for each modified TypeScript file.

**Stop condition:** If configuration cannot be snapshotted or target mutation cannot wait for the active file session, stop. A post-completion cache check cannot undo data already written to the wrong remote.

### Phase 0 checkpoint

The supported-data boundary is explicit and target-switch in-flight/restart regressions are green before deletion starts.

## 7. Phase 1 — Collapse partial SuperSync lifecycles

### Task 3: Add one background full-sync scheduler

**Size:** Medium

The scheduler observes all active full-sync runs, including foreground and initial sync; it cannot track only work it starts. `SyncWrapperService.isSyncInProgress$` spans every `sync()` run, including conflict-dialog waits, `isEncryptionOperationInProgress` covers encryption and force upload, and `SyncCycleGuard.isActive` spans the full-sync and side-channel cycle but currently has no release observable. The authoritative busy definition is the union of those three signals. Provider `SYNCING` status remains presentation state and a consistency assertion, not another exclusion authority. It is today still a real exclusion gate for the two side channels — immediate upload and WS download both skip when `isSyncInProgress` is true — but both also claim `SyncCycleGuard`, so demoting the `SYNCING` check to presentation is safe only once cycle-guard activity fully covers that side-channel exclusion (Tasks 4–5 remove those channels, so the demotion lands with them). Expose one observable busy/idle definition rather than polling the signals independently. The scheduler is the sole owner of generic pending/dirty background work; SyncCycleGuard remains authoritative for cycle exclusion.

Its public contract remains fire-and-forget `request()`. Each request captures the active provider ID plus a monotonic, in-tab configuration epoch; the scheduler revalidates them, sync enabled/readiness, and the initial/after-enable gate immediately before I/O. ProviderManager owns the non-secret epoch, incrementing it from the authoritative configuration/target transitions inventoried in Task 2; it is neither persisted nor a cross-tab protocol. A new request replaces the pending epoch with the newest current one while retaining a single dirty bit. A stale request is discarded rather than retargeted. Expose only a narrow internal settled/idle notification so high-watermark owners can re-check durable progress without a public result waiter or failure taxonomy.

Use bounded idle/running/dirty state:

| Event                                                           | Transition                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eligible current-epoch request while idle and initial gate open | Start one background full sync.                                     |
| Eligible request while any sync/maintenance is active           | Set dirty; do not make a sync call that would return HANDLED_ERROR. |
| Request becomes stale before it drains                          | Drop it without I/O; a current trigger may request again.           |
| Run succeeds and dirty is clear                                 | Return to idle.                                                     |
| Run succeeds and dirty is set                                   | Clear dirty and run once more.                                      |
| Run fails with dirty clear                                      | Return to idle; source-specific retry policy may request again.     |
| Run fails with dirty set                                        | Drain one trailing run, then apply the same rules.                  |
| Run returns `HANDLED_ERROR`                                     | Treat as a settled failure, release state, then honor dirty once.   |

Triggers during a trailing run may set dirty once again, but there is never more than one generic pending rerun. Revalidate the captured epoch before every leading or trailing run, not only when `request()` is called.

Route the existing dynamic background branch in SyncEffects — interval, resume, and visibility triggers after the initial gate — through the scheduler, alongside Tasks 4–5. Initial and after-enable triggers, before-close sync, and explicit foreground sync stay on directly awaited `sync()` calls. A background request received before initial/after-enable completion may mark dirty, but cannot start a shadow initial sync; the awaited initial path opens the gate and the scheduler then drains once. Preserve synchronous resume/visibility suppression at the existing trigger boundary.

Do not add foreground result waiters, presentation state, a public failure taxonomy, or cross-tab scheduler state. `HANDLED_ERROR` is a non-successful settled attempt, never a truthy success value.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Requests during foreground, initial, background, or maintenance work drain afterward.
- [ ] Bursts have at most one pending rerun.
- [ ] Failure releases state; source-specific retry remains outside the generic scheduler.
- [ ] Foreground result/error and initial-sync behavior are unchanged.
- [ ] No background request starts before the awaited initial/after-enable path opens the gate.
- [ ] Provider disable, provider switch, account switch, or relevant configuration change invalidates an already-queued request before I/O.
- [ ] Interval/resume/visibility triggers use the scheduler; manual, initial, after-enable, and before-close callers remain directly awaited.
- [ ] A narrow settled/idle notification lets a source re-check its own durable completion condition without making the scheduler own source state.
- [ ] There is one generic dirty owner, not one in the scheduler and another in an exclusion service.
- [ ] One observable busy definition combines wrapper, encryption/force, and cycle-guard activity and emits when SyncCycleGuard releases; provider status is not a fourth lock.

**Verification:** Unit-test idle, burst, external-busy, foreground overlap after download, maintenance overlap, dirty rerun, repeated dirty, failure, release, pre-initial request, initial completion drain, and provider/account/configuration epoch invalidation.

**Stop condition:** If direct foreground/initial runs cannot be observed, route their activity signal through the coordinator or defer Tasks 4–5. Never interpret HANDLED_ERROR as completed work; it is a truthy string, so a naive truthiness check reads it as success.

### Task 4: Make WebSocket events notification-only

**Size:** Medium, deletion-heavy

Keep the WebSocket connection/authentication transport and a thin notification adapter. A valid event records the maximum advertised sequence and requests Task 3 full sync.

The current pipeline already delegates download, conflict, and apply to the shared download core and never publishes IN_SYNC; the deletion target is its duplicated orchestration shell (session boundary, provider resolution, error-to-status mapping, cursor gate, cycle-guard claim). Since #9028 the shell also re-uploads LWW local-win ops with its own ERROR/UNKNOWN_OR_CHANGED terminal mapping (`ws-triggered-download.service.ts`); full sync already covers this more thoroughly via `SyncWrapperService`'s LWW re-upload retry loop, so notification-only WS preserves it and the adapter needs no re-upload bullet — but the deletion audit must count the re-upload as shell code that folds into full sync, not code that is silently dropped. The second IN_SYNC owner is ImmediateUploadService, removed in Task 5. The transport keeps its own reconnect/backoff and terminal auth-close handling; the adapter's suspension must not duplicate it.

The adapter owns only:

- burst/event-budget protection;
- one sequence high-watermark;
- a subscription to Task 3's narrow settled/idle notification, after which it re-reads the durable cursor;
- bounded delayed retry whenever the cursor remains below the high-watermark, regardless of whether the preceding full sync reported success or a handled transient failure;
- suspension when the active provider/configuration epoch changes, credentials become missing/not ready, or the WebSocket transport reports its terminal authentication close.

The high-watermark clears only after the durably committed cursor is greater than or equal to it. Generic full-sync success alone is insufficient. This is an intentional behavior correction: today a successful but paginated download drops the watermark without checking the cursor. Do not add a characterization test blessing the current lossy behavior. After the bounded retry budget is exhausted, retain the watermark in a dormant state; a new notification, WebSocket reconnect, or later full-sync settlement wakes one new bounded retry window. Stopping the adapter on provider/configuration transition clears the old target's watermark and invalidates its queued scheduler request.

Delete or shrink WsTriggeredDownloadService. Success means removing its direct download, validation, conflict, apply, local-win re-upload, cursor-commit, provider-status, and cycle-guard pipeline; the final thin adapter or filename may remain if that is the smallest reliable design.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] An event arriving after an active sync's download phase causes a trailing full sync.
- [ ] Success with cursor below the advertised sequence retains the high-watermark and schedules a bounded retry.
- [ ] Cursor at/above the sequence clears it.
- [ ] Cursor below the sequence after success or handled failure retries within one bounded window.
- [ ] Exhausted retry retains a dormant watermark and a later notification/reconnect/full-sync settlement can resume it.
- [ ] Missing credentials, provider/configuration transition, or terminal WebSocket auth close suspends retries and cannot retarget the request.
- [ ] Validation, conflict, apply, cursor commit, and provider status have one owner: normal full sync.

**Verification:** Cover busy arrival, cursor-below-watermark after success and handled failure, bounded retry exhaustion/wakeup, provider transition, and auth suspension with unit/integration tests. Add one opt-in live WebSocket E2E covering notification, durable cursor/replay, and restart; existing E2E defaults disable this path.

**Stop condition:** Keep a thin adapter if deleting it loses pending-event, cursor, retry, or auth semantics. Prefer one reliable path over a smaller lossy path.

### Task 5: Replace eligible immediate upload with full sync

**Size:** Medium, deletion-heavy

After the existing persistence debounce, split the current predicate into:

- stable eligibility: E2E block flag is false, client is online, and an active operation-sync-capable non-file provider exists;
- occupancy: the provider manager's active-sync signal plus the encryption-operation flag, which also covers force upload.

Stable ineligibility continues to skip. Occupancy becomes a Task 3 dirty request instead of dropping the trigger; this is the intentional behavior correction required to prevent lost local work during an active run. Capture the provider/configuration epoch with the request and revalidate it when the scheduler drains so a SuperSync trigger cannot become file-provider or different-account I/O.

Do not let this path perform an untracked initial sync. `ImmediateUploadService` currently reaches the narrower upload path, which blocks a fresh client; replacing it with full sync can also download, show the first-sync conflict flow, and run normal status/error policy. A persisted-operation trigger before initial/after-enable completion may mark the scheduler dirty but waits for the directly awaited initial path to open the gate. This accepts a short startup delay in exchange for preserving initial-sync bookkeeping without retaining a second upload lifecycle.

Do not add a manual-only check in this refactor: ImmediateUploadService does not currently have one. A manual-only behavior change needs separate product approval and tests. Provider readiness remains checked before the full sync performs I/O. The two low-level upload calls below the wrapper (encryption password change and the import-conflict coordinator) are not triggers and stay where they are.

Delete ImmediateUploadService only after piggyback ordering and the request-cost gate pass. “One extra round trip” is not assumed because full download can paginate.

**Request-cost gate:**

- deterministically count provider requests for idle/no-backlog, local backlog, and one remote-backlog case;
- compare one debounced burst before and after;
- record the delta;
- compare first-sync/fresh-client, authentication, encryption-key-missing, conflict-dialog, and status/snack behavior so the replacement does not introduce duplicate or premature presentation;
- run broader byte/latency/pagination benchmarks only if the focused bound exposes a material regression.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Eligible SuperSync local work requests one burst-coalesced full sync.
- [ ] File-provider tests prove no new automatic I/O.
- [ ] Work persisted during another run is drained rather than ignored.
- [ ] Work persisted before or during initial/after-enable sync drains only after that awaited path completes.
- [ ] A queued request invalidated by provider disable, provider/account switch, or relevant configuration change performs no I/O.
- [ ] Piggybacked operations apply durably before local entries are marked synced.
- [ ] Fresh-client, auth, encryption, conflict, status, and snack behavior has an explicit before/after verdict in addition to request counts.
- [ ] The upload-only production pipeline and references are gone.

**Verification:** Cover stable eligibility, file-provider exclusion, pre-initial/during-initial/after-enable timing, provider-epoch invalidation, foreground/maintenance overlap, piggyback ordering, behavior outcomes, and request counts with unit/integration tests. Extend the single live notification/restart E2E with one local append if practical. Run the scheduled SuperSync/WebDAV workflow.

**Stop condition:** Retain ImmediateUploadService if the focused request delta is unacceptable or stable provider eligibility cannot be preserved. Do not rebuild upload-only policy inside the scheduler.

### Phase 1 incidental deletions (verified zero or spec-only references)

Bundle these with the matching task; re-verify references at deletion time:

- SyncTriggerService's `_onUpdateLocalDataTrigger$` source is now a dead `of(null)` (its former local-data-change semantics are gone), **but the branch it feeds is not dead** and must not be removed as a zero-reference cleanup. `_immediateSyncTrigger$.pipe(startWith(...), switchMap(() => _onUpdateLocalDataTrigger$.pipe(auditTime(syncInterval))))` fires a trailing full sync ~`syncInterval` after activity settles: `of(null) | auditTime(N)` emits one trailing value after N ms, and `switchMap` re-subscribes on every immediate trigger. For SuperSync `useIntervalTimer` is false, so this is the only periodic re-sync. Treat it as behavior: preserve the trailing/settle cadence through the scheduler, or make its removal an explicit, tested cadence change — not an incidental deletion (Task 5).
- Legacy SyncStatus enum members UpdateLocalAll, Conflict, IncompleteRemoteData, and NotConfigured; the wrapper only returns InSync/UpdateRemote today (Task 3).
- The deprecated `skipDuringSync` alias of `skipWhileApplyingRemoteOps` (spec-only references).
- The write-only plain `isDataImportInProgress` field on ImexViewService; the observable stays.
- After Tasks 4–5 delete the two side-channel error-to-status mapping blocks (WS and immediate-upload, near-identical to each other), extract their shared subset into a helper. The wrapper's block is a superset with many extra branches (CORS, auth, decrypt, timeout, empty-body); extract the shared mapping, do not replace the wrapper block with it.

### Phase 1 checkpoint

- WebSocket and eligible SuperSync local-operation events reach normal full sync without lost work.
- File providers have no new automatic traffic.
- Foreground and initial-sync semantics are unchanged.
- The live notification/restart E2E and scheduled SuperSync/WebDAV jobs pass.
- The phase deletes substantially more lifecycle policy than it adds.

## 8. Phase 2 — Remove proven-disposable conflict surfaces

### Task 6: Perform a focused conflict-review rollback

**Size:** Large deletion, gated by Task 1

Remove only what the supported-build/persisted-data decision authorizes:

- conflict journal writing;
- review route/UI, banner, badge, navigation, and translations;
- journal persistence only after its read/export/expiry obligation ends.

Preserve:

- **the disjoint-field merge itself — planner (`conflict-disjoint-merge.util.ts`), patch-op writing, and the failed-merge fallback. Removing it re-introduces #9095: whole-entity LWW silently and permanently destroys the losing side's concurrent field edits (a rename dies when another device marks the task done). Journal removal ≠ merge removal — this task rolls back the _review/journal_ feature, not the merge;**
- schema version 3 replace/patch compatibility and its v2-to-v3 migration/barrier;
- schema version 4 and its v3-to-v4 migration/barrier, `PROJECT_DELETE_WINS_MARKER`, the authenticated project-ID gate (`isProjectDeleteWinsOperation` requiring `op.entityId === payload.projectId` — distinct from the decrypt-path footprint authentication in contract 14), the shared-package (`@sp/sync-core`) delete-wins classification consumed by the client planner (the server does not classify delete-wins — the marker lives inside the E2EE auth tag and is unreadable server-side), local replacement-op construction, and union of cascaded task/note IDs across concurrent marked deletes;
- IndexedDB version 10 downgrade protection;
- replace/patch payload types, conversion/replay, and supported persisted fixtures;
- ordinary single- and multi-entity conflict recovery, including historical unmarked project-delete loser recovery, task/subtask recreation and the winning-project cascade recreation of notes/sections/task-repeat-cfgs (#9048, `_createCascadeRecreationOpsForWinningProject`) plus its concurrent-delete divergence guards, exact project/parent relationship follow-ups, same-batch delete exclusion, and replacement when a recovery row later loses its own conflict;
- replay-atomic project moves and the marked recreation handling shared by conflict resolution, superseded-operation replacement, LWW meta-reducers, and task/project/section reducers;
- atomic file-snapshot baseline, post-snapshot suffix, hydration-time local-edit, archive-serialization, live-versus-hydration, and transaction-rollback coverage;
- the legacy whole-file conflict dialog (DialogSyncConflictComponent under imex/sync), which predates the review feature and stays;
- unrelated fixes added after 962c5bbeb1.

There is no Flip-specific operation handler to remove. UI deletion must not touch generic entity-update capture/replay.

Known seams for the deletion diff: inside ConflictResolutionService the merge producer shares the recovery apply batch, checkpoint-exempt op IDs, the atomic mixed-source append, and the failed-merge fallback re-entry with the multi-entity recovery fixes (#8990, #9007). Its whole-entity-win guard now covers both archive wins and schema-v4 marked project deletes (#9009); the disjoint branch itself STAYS (see Preserve) — the deletion here is journal/UI only, and must touch neither the merge branch nor the guard or delete-win plan. Recreation markers and follow-up builders are consumed by superseded-operation recovery and the replay-safe task/project/section reducers (#9001). Two post-baseline additions expand that shared surface: the #9048 cascade-recreation helpers (`_createCascadeRecreationOpsForWinningProject`, `_collectDeletedEntityIds`, `_getCurrentEntitiesOfType`) are recovery code sharing the recreation markers and clock-merge helpers with the delete-win family — not the merge producer; and the whole-entity LWW `localWinOperationKind:'update'` local-win path (with its delete-recreation branch) is now also reached via the #9035 deterministic clientId tiebreak in `@sp/sync-core` — keep it. The verified disjoint branch remains cleanly separable (none of #9045/#9048/#9035/#9025 touched it). Review the diff against those seams specifically. The journal clearAll() hooks in OperationLogSyncService and BackupService stay wired while the reader/store stays and leave only with the store; since #9045 clearAll() also writes the `SUP_CONFLICT_JOURNAL_CLEARED_BEFORE` localStorage privacy marker, so store removal must also drop that key and the marker-writing in both hooks. The corruption-classification WeakSet side channel exists only for journal taxonomy and goes with the writer. Disjoint-merge eligibility is coupled to the recreate-fallback constants; the review-UI translations exist in en.json only.

If supported users can still have journal rows, first stop new writes and retain a read-only review/export path for the decided support window. Do not orphan or silently delete the only discarded values.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] The disjoint-field merge remains active and #9095's rename-vs-done regression spec stays green.
- [ ] Stored v3 replace/patch operations and v4 marked/unmarked project deletions still download/replay with their original semantics from every supported backend.
- [ ] No schema downgrade, DB downgrade, or generic update removal appears in the diff.
- [ ] Marked project delete-wins, historical losing-delete recovery, relationship follow-ups, same-batch delete exclusion, recovery-row replacement, and replay-atomic project-move tests remain green.
- [ ] File-snapshot atomicity, post-snapshot suffix, concurrent-compaction / immutable-snapshot resolution (#9040), hydration-time local edits, and archive-serialization tests remain green.
- [ ] Removed UI/writers have zero production references.
- [ ] Journal DB deletion, if any, matches the approved data policy.
- [ ] The diff is reviewed against 962c5bbeb1 and current master so later fixes are not swept away.

**Verification:** Run focused conflict, capture/replay, persistence integration, migration, supported provider/server fixtures, the full unit suite, required checkFile commands, and a deletion-focused diff audit.

**Stop condition:** If a symbol is both a feature producer and compatibility reader, split the roles and keep the reader. If that cannot be done cleanly, keep the path rather than risk unreadable data.

## 9. Phase 3 — Consolidate documentation

### Task 7: Correct current documentation without a competing truth source

**Size:** Small to medium

Correct known false current-state claims, including the current schema version (v4), the v2-to-v3 and v3-to-v4 barriers, project-delete-wins versus historical timestamp-LWW semantics, the deterministic clientId LWW tiebreak (#9035), the whole-entity-win disjoint-merge guard, atomic file-snapshot hydration and immutable per-compaction snapshots (#9040), decrypt-path metadata/footprint authentication (#9045), and the ALL_ACTIONS capture exception. After Tasks 3–6 settle, publish a short invariant index only if it replaces duplicated prose or clearly marks older architecture documents historical.

Do not add a mandatory enforcement/test matrix merely to satisfy this plan. Link focused enforcement/tests where they clarify a non-obvious invariant, and keep proposed behavior out of current-contract documentation.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Current-status documentation identifies schema v4; schema v1-v3 references remain only where they are explicitly historical or describe compatibility/migration behavior.
- [ ] Conflict-review behavior matches the final Task 6 decision.
- [ ] Project-delete-wins, historical losing-delete recovery (including #9048 cascade), clientId LWW tiebreak (#9035), file-snapshot atomicity and immutable per-compaction snapshots (#9040), hydration-time local edits, and archive serialization match current code.
- [ ] README, contributor guidance, operation rules, and architecture status do not contradict one another.
- [ ] There is one clearly identified current contract surface, not another coverage ledger.

**Stop condition:** If a new document would mostly duplicate maintained guidance, update and link the existing guidance instead.

## 10. Separate correctness proposals

These issues are real, but coupling them to the deletion roadmap worsens reviewability and rollback.

### A. Atomic current/current browser startup

A separate proposal should:

- acquire a page-lifetime Web Lock before DataInitService construction, hydration, or SUP_OPS open;
- prove the losing current tab never hydrates or captures;
- test simultaneous startup, owner close/crash, and later startup;
- retain early BroadcastChannel compatibility for old clients without claiming an old/current atomic guarantee;
- define supported behavior when Web Locks are unavailable.

This improves current/current ownership but does not make an old client participate. No sync simplification may claim mixed-version safety from this lock alone.

### B. Race-free sync and destructive-maintenance exclusion

First introduce a behavior-neutral coordinator backed by current flag/guard behavior. Route owner families through it in small commits while the old implementation remains the sole authority:

- normal and force sync;
- encryption enable/disable/password change;
- JSON import and local-backup restore;
- SuperSync restore;
- profile switching before its first mutation;
- undo/recovery replacement.

Only after no owner bypasses the coordinator should its internals switch to one exclusive boundary. Preserve foreground try-now semantics, at least the current 90-second maintenance wait, and already-owned internal helpers for nested force/conflict paths. JSON replacement and encryption/server-reset handling stay in one acquisition. Optimistic capture keeps its short operation-log lock. Work that holds `sp_op_log` (in-lock validation/repair included) must stay non-blocking — #9026 removed the last blocking native dialog from that path; the coordinator migration must not reintroduce one. Note that `sp_op_log` is a distinct, lower-level lock from this proposal's 90-second maintenance-exclusion wait.

When Web Locks exist, test two current clients even if startup detection races. For mixed old/current and unsupported browsers, state the remaining limitation; do not disable core offline workflows or claim a guarantee that the old client cannot honor.

SyncCycleGuardService can be deleted only after this project owns every cycle entry and production references are zero.

## 11. Deferred compatibility work

No compatibility deletion is authorized merely by completing this plan.

## 12. Reassessment and approval

After each phase collect:

- production lifecycle owners and lines deleted versus added;
- remaining owners of validation, conflict, cursor, provider status, retry, and pending work;
- focused, full-suite, live-trigger, and scheduled E2E failures;
- deterministic provider request deltas;
- persisted-format/downgrade fixture results for schema-v3 replace/patch and schema-v4 marked/unmarked project deletions;
- file-snapshot atomicity, post-snapshot suffix, concurrent-compaction / immutable-snapshot resolution, hydration-time local-edit, and archive-serialization results;
- stale-request invalidation across provider, account, and configuration transitions;
- consumer counts for SyncSessionValidationService and SyncCycleGuardService (Tasks 4–5 each remove consumers, strengthening proposal B);
- known cross-tab limitations.

### Expected footprint (evidence, not a target)

Measured against baseline `6fefd741c5`, to anchor the "removes more than it adds" gate — not a goal to optimize toward:

| Tranche                                      | Gross production lines removed (approx.)                              | Added                              |

| Task 5 — ImmediateUploadService (394)        | ~370                                                                  | ~30 predicate→request wiring       |

Net production reduction is roughly **1,600–2,100 lines** with the journal store retained (down from the pre-rescope 2,350–2,850 — the ~710–780-line disjoint-merge tranche now stays, #9095), rising toward **~2,250–2,750** once its retention/export obligation ends and the store+model go. This is deliberately far below the rejected "~6,000 lines together" figure: the difference is the kept merge, compatibility readers, delete-wins/recovery follow-ups, and thin adapters that stay. Test-file churn is larger still (review specs removed; disjoint-merge specs stay) but is not counted here — it roughly nets out against new scheduler/adapter/isolation specs and is not the success measure. The number a phase must clear is qualitative (contract 19 and §4's last line): it removes behavioral states and failure paths, not just lines.

Approve work in reviewable tranches:

1. deployed-build/persisted-data audit;
2. file-target isolation fix;
3. background scheduler;
4. WebSocket pipeline collapse;
5. eligible immediate-upload collapse after the request-cost gate;
6. focused conflict rollback after the data audit;
7. documentation consolidation.

Do not combine phases into one pull request. Keep the browser-startup and destructive-maintenance proposals outside these tranches.

Suggested commits:

1. docs(sync): audit conflict data compatibility
2. fix(sync): isolate state across file target changes
3. refactor(sync): coalesce background full-sync requests
4. refactor(sync): route websocket notifications through full sync
5. refactor(sync): replace eligible immediate upload with full sync
6. refactor(sync): remove disposable conflict review paths
7. docs(sync): consolidate current sync contracts

Every implementation commit contains focused tests. Every modified TypeScript or SCSS file passes npm run checkFile <filepath>. Run the scheduled SuperSync/WebDAV workflow for provider or trigger behavior changes.
