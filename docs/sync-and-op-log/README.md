# Operation Log & Sync Documentation

The Operation Log is the **single client sync pipeline** for SuperSync and file
providers. Persistent NgRx actions update the live projection and are captured
as durable operations; restart uses a structurally screened snapshot plus the
retained operation tail. Vector clocks detect causal order and concurrent edits.

               (ordered op API)           (shared v2 or v3 envelopes)
```

The v2/v3 envelopes are common adapter formats, not a common physical write
guarantee. Dropbox and OneDrive can enforce API compare-and-swap (CAS), while
WebDAV/Nextcloud is atomic only when the server supplies strong ETags; weak or
missing ETags fall back to a best-effort check. LocalFile likewise has a
best-effort read/check/write race and is single-writer/backup-only.

Current mechanics live in the executable owners linked by these documents.
Overview and history documents explain the model but do not override code,
tests, or a focused contract.

Retired diagram filenames remain as small forwarding stubs so historical links
continue to resolve. `operation-rules.md` and `sqlite-migration-followup.md` are
also compatibility pointers; they are not independent sources of current
behavior or status.
