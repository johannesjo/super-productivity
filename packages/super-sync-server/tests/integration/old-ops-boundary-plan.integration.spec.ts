/**
 * Plan guard for the old-ops sweep's fleet-wide BOUNDARY SCAN, on a REAL PostgreSQL —
 * production's major version, not PGlite's.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `deleteOldSyncedOpsForAllUsers` opens with one fleet-wide `groupBy`
 * that computes every user's causal boundary:
 *
 *   SELECT user_id, MAX(server_seq) FROM operations
 *   WHERE server_seq > 1 AND <CAUSAL_FULL_STATE_OPERATION_WHERE>
 *   GROUP BY user_id
 *
 * It is the ONLY statement in that function outside the per-candidate `try`, so its
 * failure is not one user's skip — it is the whole fleet's retention pass. On 2026-08-29
 * it was cancelled at the 60s `statement_timeout` (57014) and the sweep pruned nothing:
 * an ERROR line with no accompanying "removed N", the exact signature `cleanup.ts` logs
 * unconditionally to make visible. The sibling specs pin the PROBE
 * (old-ops-probe-plan) and the DELETE batches (old-ops-delete-plan); this statement — the
 * one that actually aborted the sweep — had no plan guard at all.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS SLOW. Production measured the index side at 2.5ms / 92 buffers and the
 * Bitmap Heap Scan at 33,728ms / 3,930 heap blocks: ~100% of the runtime is random heap
 * access, because `op_type` and `repair_base_server_seq` are not in the broad partial
 * index and the residual Filter costs one heap visit per candidate row. At the host's
 * ~150 IOPS those blocks are ~24s of pure I/O, which is why the statement sat BISTABLE
 * around the 60s cap — 33.7s with a half-warm cache, over the cap whenever an autovacuum
 * was competing for the same disk. So the budget that matters here is HEAP FETCHES, not
 * wall time and not `blocks` (a warm page is a hit and hides the whole problem).
 *
 * WHY `INCLUDE` WAS NOT THE FIX, which is what this file's first test really pins.
 * `predicate_implied_by` cannot prove `(A OR B) => op_type IN (3-set)`: predtest.c's rule
 * for a disjunctive predicate is "the clause implies SOME ONE disjunct", and a clause that
 * is itself an OR needs case analysis the prover does not do. So no index-only path is
 * generated at all and the only route into the broad index is `generate_bitmap_or_paths`
 * splitting the OR into two provable arms — the duplicated `BitmapOr` in the production
 * plan, the same index scanned twice and OR'd with itself. A Bitmap Heap Scan discards the
 * index tuple, so INCLUDE columns are unreachable by construction. Migration
 * 20260829000000 instead gives the index the causal predicate VERBATIM, so
 * `create_indexscan_plan` drops the whole OR as implied-by-predicate and `server_seq`
 * answers what is left as a key column.
 *
 * MEASURED UNDER force_custom_plan — deliberately, and this file is the exception to
 * explain-plan.helper.ts's "never measure the custom plan" rule. A PARTIAL index is
 * unreachable under a generic plan at all: with `Param` nodes there are no `Const`s for
 * `operator_predicate_proof`, so `predOK` is false for every partial index on this table.
 * Production measured custom = BitmapOr cost 22,844 against generic = Parallel Seq Scan
 * cost 982,701, and `choose_custom_plan` adopts the generic plan only when its cost is at
 * or below the average custom cost — a 43x margin that pins this statement on custom
 * plans. That margin is a load-bearing assumption rather than a detail, so the third test
 * asserts it directly. If it ever inverts, CI fails instead of production.
 *
 * THE PARTIAL INDEXES ARE CREATED BY THIS SPEC, not by the schema. Prisma has no
 * partial-index syntax, so both live only in raw migrations and a `prisma db push`
 * database has NEITHER (#9192) — which is how CI provisions
 * (supersync-server-tests.yml), so dropping them again in `afterAll` restores the exact
 * starting state. Their DDL is READ OUT OF the migration files rather than copied, so
 * this file cannot drift into measuring a world that does not ship.
 *
 * Prerequisites, as for the other *.integration.spec.ts files: a real PostgreSQL with the
 * schema applied (`prisma db push`) and DATABASE_URL set; skipped entirely when unset.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
 *     tests/integration/old-ops-boundary-plan.integration.spec.ts
