/**
 * Plan guard for the old-ops sweep's fresh-prefix probe, on a REAL PostgreSQL —
 * production's major version, not PGlite's.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG. `deleteOldSyncedOpsForAllUsers` asks, once per candidate, "does this
 * user still hold an op below the causal boundary but inside the retention window?"
 *
 *   findFirst({ where: { userId, serverSeq: { lt }, receivedAt: { gte } },
 *               orderBy: { receivedAt: 'asc' }, select: { serverSeq: true } })
 *
 * The predicate is a 2D range and NO index answers both sides as search bounds, so one
 * side is always a residual Filter and there are two candidate plans:
 *
 *   A  operations_user_id_received_at_idx   — bounded by the RETENTION WINDOW
 *   B  operations_user_id_server_seq_key    — bounded by the user's ENTIRE AGED PREFIX
 *
 * (A is the LEGACY 2-col index. The schema has since replaced it with the covering
 * 3-col form — see the COVERING_IDX note below for how this file measures both worlds.)
 *
 * B is what hit the 60s `statement_timeout` (57014) on production, and because the throw
 * escaped the per-candidate loop it cost the WHOLE FLEET its nightly retention pass. B is
 * worst precisely on the deepest histories — the cohort the sweep exists to prune — so it
 * degrades every day it fails.
 *
 * WHY IT WAS A COIN FLIP, WHICH IS THE ACTUAL DEFECT. Without the ORDER BY, A and B are
 * not merely close: with both indexes grown organically by the same inserts (production,
 * and the original form of this seed) PostgreSQL 16 costs them BIT-IDENTICALLY (both
 * `0.29..32.17 rows=2`), because under a generic plan each is "equality on user_id plus
 * one range with default selectivity". Measured, A touches 9 buffers and B touches
 * 60,329 — a ~6700x difference the cost model cannot see at all. Which one you get is
 * settled by tie-breaking no version promises to keep stable, so the same statement can
 * be instant on one server and fatal on another, or flip after a REINDEX. The second test
 * below pins that tie, because the tie IS the bug. (This harness now REBUILDS the legacy
 * index — see LEGACY_DDL — and a CREATE INDEX packs pages tighter than organic growth,
 * so the two costs land a percent or two apart here rather than byte-equal; that gap is
 * physical-stat noise, and the test asserts it stays inside noise.)
 *
 * SO THE CANDIDATES ARE MEASURED ONE AT A TIME, each with the other's index dropped inside
 * a rolled-back transaction, and no test asserts which one an unordered EXPLAIN returns.
 * That return is the flip itself, and it really does differ between machines: the seed
 * below yields the window index on one PostgreSQL 16 install and the prefix index on
 * GitHub Actions' 16.15. Reading it as "the candidate the planner chose" is how the first
 * version of this file came to fail CI while asserting something true.
 *
 * WHAT THE ORDER BY DOES. It is not a hint and it does not "prefer" A. It changes the
 * problem so the candidates stop being equivalent: A already emits `received_at` order
 * under an equality qual on `user_id`, so it sorts for free AND keeps LIMIT-1 pushdown
 * (cost 16.23), while B must add a blocking Sort over the whole matching set, losing the
 * early exit (cost 30.86). An exact tie becomes a ~2x margin and the coin flip is gone.
 * The ordering is also free of SEMANTIC risk: the probe asks only whether such a row
 * EXISTS, so which qualifying row comes back cannot change the sweep's decision.
 *
 * MEASURED UNDER force_generic_plan. Prisma sends prepared statements, so the plan is
 * built with the parameter values invisible — which is what makes the candidates tie in
 * the first place. `EXPLAIN` with literals shows a different, healthier world and would
 * hide this entirely. See explain-plan.helper.ts.
 *
 * THE SEED IS THE WHOLE TEST — do not shrink it. Under `force_generic_plan` the planner
 * estimates `user_id = $1` at ntuples/n_distinct, so a two-user seed makes that estimate
 * accurate, both candidates look cheap, and the file proves nothing. Production has ~11.5k
 * users. Hence USER_COUNT, and hence the CANARY: if B ever stops being catastrophic on
 * this seed, the seed has stopped reproducing production and every other assertion here is
 * vacuous — which is a FAILURE, not a pass.
 *
 * Prerequisites, as for the other *.integration.spec.ts files: a real PostgreSQL with the
 * schema applied (`prisma db push`) and DATABASE_URL set; skipped entirely when unset.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts \
