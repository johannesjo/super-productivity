/**
 * Shared EXPLAIN harness for the conflict-lookup plan specs.
 *
 * Extracted because it was copied, and the copy rotted: the batch spec's walker was
 * fixed to multiply the discarded-row counters by `Actual Loops` and to read
 * `Rows Removed by Join Filter`, while the single-entity spec's copy kept
 * under-reporting by up to the loop count and scored a join fan-out as zero. Both specs
 * exist to catch cost regressions on the upload path, so a blind spot in either is the
 * same class of bug. One implementation, one place to fix.
 *
 * The runner is structural rather than `PGlite` so the same walker also drives a REAL
 * PostgreSQL connection (batch-conflict-plan.integration.spec.ts). PGlite is PG18 and
 * production is PG 16.x; the two planners disagree about this exact query — see that
 * spec's header — so the numbers have to be reproducible on both without a second
 * implementation to keep in sync.
