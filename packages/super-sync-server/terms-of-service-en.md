# General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

**Super Productivity Sync**
_Last updated: 08.12.2025_

## 1. Scope and Provider

(1) These General Terms and Conditions ("GTC") govern the use of the service **Super Productivity Sync** ("Service"), operated by **Johannes Millan** ("Provider").

(2) By registering for or using the Service, the user ("User") declares their agreement with these GTC.

(3) The contract language is German. Deviating terms and conditions of the User do not apply unless the Provider expressly agrees to their validity in writing.

## 2. Subject of Service

(1) The Service enables the cloud-based synchronization of data for the application "Super Productivity".

(2) The Service is provided in its currently available version ("as available"). The Provider may further develop, modify, restrict, or discontinue the Service at any time. There is no claim to a specific technical or functional configuration.

## 3. Registration and Requirements for Use

(1) Use of the Service requires full legal capacity or effective representation.

(2) The User undertakes to provide accurate information during registration and to keep access data secure.

(3) The User is responsible for all actions taken via their account, insofar as they are responsible for such actions.

## 4. Data Security and Encryption

**(1) Standard Security (without Encryption-at-Rest)**
Data transmission is encrypted (SSL/TLS). However, storage is by default **not** end-to-end encrypted and is without assurance of server-side database encryption ("Encryption at Rest"). The User acknowledges that the Provider and its hosting service providers can theoretically technically access unencrypted database content, insofar as this is technically necessary for maintenance or error analysis.

**(2) Optional End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**
The User may optionally activate end-to-end encryption. The following conditions apply:

- The keys are generated and managed exclusively locally by the User.
- **Warning:** The Provider has absolutely no access to these keys and can **not** recover, unlock, or reset encrypted data.
- Loss of the key results in the permanent and irrevocable loss of access to the affected data.
- The E2EE function is provided without assurance of freedom from errors, compatibility, or permanent availability.

**(3) Data Backup**
Backups are performed by the Provider exclusively on a best-effort basis. There is no guarantee of completeness, integrity, or recoverability. The User is obligated to create reasonable and regular local backup copies of their data.

## 5. Obligations of the User

(1) The User undertakes:

- not to misuse the Service (e.g., attacks, excessive load, circumvention of security mechanisms);
- not to upload illegal content, malware, or third-party data without authorization;
- to make the choice of security level (with/without E2EE) independently based on the sensitivity of their data.

**(2) Indemnification**
If the User culpably violates statutory regulations or these GTC and the Provider is held liable by third parties as a result, the User shall indemnify the Provider against all related claims, insofar as the User is responsible for the violation.

## 6. Availability

The Provider strives for high availability but does not guarantee uninterrupted use. Maintenance work, technical faults, failures at hosting providers, or force majeure may lead to restrictions.

## 7. Liability

(1) The Provider is liable without limitation in cases of intent, gross negligence, and culpable injury to life, body, or health.

(2) In cases of slight negligence, the Provider is only liable for the breach of essential contractual obligations (**Cardinal Obligations**). In these cases, liability is limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract.

(3) **Data Loss:** Liability for data loss is limited to the effort that would have been required for recovery assuming proper, reasonable, and regular data backup by the User. If the User has not created sufficient backups, liability is excluded insofar as the damage would have been avoidable through backups.

(4) **E2EE Data:** The Provider is not liable for data loss, data corruption, or inaccessibility attributable to key loss, incorrect key management by the User, or use of the optional E2EE function.

(5) The above limitations of liability also apply in favor of the Provider's vicarious agents.

## 8. Prices and Payment Terms

(1) Paid features and their prices are determined by the respective order process. All prices are final prices including statutory VAT, where applicable.

(2) The term, billing cycle, and notice period for paid plans are determined by the conditions stated in the order process.

## 9. Term and Termination

(1) The User may delete their account at any time and thereby terminate the contract.

(2) The Provider may terminate the contractual relationship at any time with a notice period of two (2) weeks (for free services) or block or terminate the contract without notice for good cause.

(3) For paid services, the notice periods stated in the order process apply.

## 10. Amendments to the GTC

(1) The Provider may amend these GTC if necessary to adapt to:

- technical developments,
- changes in legal frameworks,
- new functions, security requirements, or business models.

(2) Amendments will be communicated to the User in text form at least six (6) weeks before they take effect. The notification will include a reference to:

- the User's right to object,
- the right to terminate the contract for good cause,
- the consequences of silence (failure to object).

(3) If the User does not object within the period, the amendments are deemed accepted.

(4) If the User objects, the Provider may terminate the contractual relationship with a notice period of two (2) weeks, provided that adhering to the contract under the old conditions is unreasonable.

## 11. Right of Withdrawal for Consumers

If the User is a consumer pursuant to § 13 BGB (German Civil Code) and concludes a paid contract, they are entitled to a statutory right of withdrawal. Details are regulated in the separate cancellation policy.

## 12. Data Protection

The processing of personal data takes place in accordance with the Privacy Policy for Super Productivity Sync.

## 13. Final Provisions

(1) The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the UN Sales Convention (CISG).

(2) If the User is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, **Leipzig** is the exclusive place of jurisdiction. Statutory places of jurisdiction apply to consumers.

(3) **Severability Clause:** Should individual provisions of these GTC be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions remains unaffected. The statutory provisions shall take the place of the invalid regulation.

(4) Platform of the EU Commission for Online Dispute Resolution: [https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/). The Provider is not obligated and not willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.
