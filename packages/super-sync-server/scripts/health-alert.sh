# SuperSync Health Alert Script
#
# Checks container health and sends an email alert if something is wrong.
# Designed to run via cron every 5 minutes.
#
# Setup:
#   chmod +x scripts/health-alert.sh
#   crontab -e
#   */5 * * * * ALERT_EMAIL=you@example.com /path/to/super-sync-server/scripts/health-alert.sh
#
# Configuration (set these or pass via environment):
#   ALERT_EMAIL    - Email address to receive alerts (required)
#   MAIL_CMD       - mail binary to use (default: mail); a test seam
#   JOURNAL_CMD    - journalctl binary to use (default: journalctl); a test seam
#   COMPOSE_DIR    - Path to docker-compose.yml directory (default: script directory's parent)
#   HEALTH_URL     - Health endpoint URL (default: read from .env DOMAIN)
#   MAX_QUERY_SECONDS  - Alert if any query has been active longer (default: 120)
#   POOL_WARN_PCT      - Alert if this % of the pool is concurrently BUSY -- running a
#                        query or holding a transaction (default: 75). Idle pooled
#                        connections are not counted; see MONITORING-README.md check 7.
#   POSTGRES_SERVICE   - Bundled database service to health-check
#                        (default: postgres; empty: none)

# Do NOT use set -e — a monitoring script must never silently abort.

# 2. Check for OOM kills via kernel log (docker OOMKilled flag resets on restart)
# Deliberately OUTSIDE the $DOCKER_OK gate: reading the kernel log needs no daemon, and a
# host that has just OOM-killed something is exactly when dockerd is least likely to
# answer -- gating this on Docker skipped the check in its own scenario. It also keeps the
# blind-marker lifecycle running while Docker is down, so deploy.sh cannot report a
# stale "BLIND since <onset>" the operator already fixed.
# For a cron user outside 'adm'/'systemd-journal' -- or on a host with no journalctl at
# all -- `journalctl -k` emits no kernel line and exits 0, so the count below is 0
# forever and the check silently never fires. Probe with an UNBOUNDED -n 1 first: a
# quiet 6-minute window is also empty, so the bounded query below cannot tell "no OOM"
# from "no access". (dmesg is no fallback: kernel.dmesg_restrict locks out the same
# users.) A blind check is a broken capability, not a health finding: it goes to the
# marker deploy.sh surfaces, NEVER to PROBLEMS -- same rule, and same reason, as the
# MAIL_AVAILABLE precedent above. PROBLEMS is the dedupe hash input and its emptiness
# gates the recovery mail, so a permanent entry there would kill "Health Check
# Recovered" forever on any host that simply lacks the group.
# `command -v` first, matching the MAIL_AVAILABLE probe above: an ABSENT journalctl and an
# UNREADABLE journal both yield empty output, but only one of them is the operator's to
# fix. On a non-systemd host (Alpine — and Dockerfile:60 ships scripts/ to self-hosters)
# there is no journal, no 'systemd-journal' group, and nothing to repair, so telling those
# operators to join a group forever is unactionable noise. Marker line 2 carries the
# reason, same shape as record_mail_failure, and deploy.sh picks the advice from it.
# Both branches write only on a TRANSITION: the condition is permanent, and cron mails
# every line of output -- an unconditional echo is 288 mails/day into the same inbox as
# the real alerts. A CHANGED reason counts as a transition, because the two get opposite
# advice from deploy.sh and a stale line 2 would keep withholding the actionable one; the
# onset in line 1 is carried over, which is what deploy.sh's "since" claims.
# Both reads are bounded for the same reason send_alert_mail and the db probe are: this
# runs under the flock, so a journalctl blocked on a corrupt or slow journal does not just
# lose the OOM check -- every later cron run finds the lock held and exits 0 silently,
# which is the "monitoring stopped and nobody noticed" failure this whole script exists to
# prevent. A journal that cannot answer in 10s is unreadable for our purposes anyway.
