# Generic, name-agnostic Prisma migration deploy + recovery.
#
# Prisma 5.x wraps every migration in a transaction. PostgreSQL forbids
# CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY inside a transaction block, so such a
# migration fails with P3018 / SQLSTATE 25001 ("cannot run inside a
# transaction block"), and a later deploy then refuses with P3009 (the
# migration is stuck in a failed state).
#
# This script has two deliberately narrow recovery paths:
#
# 1. For the transaction-block failure above, it runs a migration with the safe
#    DROP+CREATE CONCURRENTLY shape out-of-band, marks it applied, and retries.
# 2. For the two-statement SET LOCAL lock_timeout + ALTER INDEX ... SET (...)
#    shape, it rolls back Prisma's failed record and retries a bounded number of
#    times through Prisma. It never splits or marks that transactional migration
#    applied itself. The gate is on SHAPE, never on a migration or index name.
#
# Both paths discover the failing migration from Prisma's output and inspect
# prisma/migrations/<name>/migration.sql. Anything matching neither guarded
# recovery path fails loudly.
#
# A P1002 advisory-lock timeout (another session holds Prisma's migration lock,
# usually a migrator container orphaned by a prior interrupted deploy) is NOT a
# migration failure: it is detected separately and printed with cleanup steps,
# never auto-resolved.
#
# This script is COPYed into the image next to prisma/migrations in the same
# build, so it is always version-locked to the migrations it must handle. All
# three call sites (host deploy.sh, image startup CMD, helm initContainer)
# invoke it, so it carries its own step timeout as defense-in-depth (deploy.sh
# also wraps it; the CMD/initContainer paths have no outer timeout).
#
# OUT-OF-BAND RECOVERABLE shape: a migration whose SQL
# contains BOTH a DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY and a CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, so
# re-running it out-of-band is idempotent and clears a half-built INVALID index
# first:
#
#     DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS "x";
#     CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "x" ON ...;
#
# A bare `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (no DROP) is INTENTIONALLY not recovered:
# such migrations (e.g. 20260511000000) are written to fail loudly rather than
# be marked applied with a possibly-INVALID index. They fall through to a loud
# failure here by gate, deterministically.
#
# Statements must end with `;` at end of line, comments must be full-line `--`,
# and `;` must not appear inside string literals (true for all index DDL).

#
# Each attempt is a `migrate resolve` plus a `migrate deploy`, so two Prisma CLI

# all. Note the budget is PER MIGRATION (the counter resets when the failing

# A lock-bounded migration: exactly two statements, a SET LOCAL lock_timeout

# Prisma transaction semantics (SET LOCAL must apply to the ALTER, and a
# successful native retry must be what records it as applied), and re-running it
# from scratch is free, so a lock timeout can safely be retried.
#
# Gated on SHAPE, never on a migration or index name; absence of names is
# enforced by tests/migration-sql.spec.ts. Rationale: prisma/migrations/README.md.
#
# Three properties are enforced below, and a fourth follows from them:
#   - a SHORT lock_timeout bound (<= 5s). This is the load-bearing one: the point
#     of the bound is to fail fast rather than queue new queries behind a waiting
#     ACCESS EXCLUSIVE request, so a long value ('30min') — or a disabled one
#     ('0', which means wait forever in PostgreSQL) — must never be retried at
#     all, let alone MAX_LOCK_ATTEMPTS times;
#   - exactly two statements, so Postgres wraps them in an implicit transaction
#     and a lock timeout rolls the whole migration back with nothing partially
#     applied;
#   - an ALTER INDEX ... SET (reloption), which is idempotent on re-run.
# The fourth — no CONCURRENTLY — is NOT a separate check: it follows from the
# ALTER pattern being fully anchored with a paren-free option list, so the
# ALTER's own `)` always lands inside the span and nothing can follow it. That
# matters because split_statements breaks on `;` at END OF LINE, so the
# statement count alone would not stop a CONCURRENTLY build sharing the ALTER's
# line — and a SINGLE-statement migration gets no implicit transaction, so a
# lock timeout mid-build leaves an INVALID index a blind retry cannot clear.
#
# Matched with grep -Ei, like the CONCURRENTLY gates above, so that spacing and
