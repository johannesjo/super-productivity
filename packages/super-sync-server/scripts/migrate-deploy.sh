# Generic, name-agnostic Prisma migration deploy + recovery.
#
# Prisma 5.x wraps every migration in a transaction. PostgreSQL forbids
# CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY inside a transaction block, so such a
# migration fails with P3018 / SQLSTATE 25001 ("cannot run inside a
# transaction block"), and a later deploy then refuses with P3009 (the
# migration is stuck in a failed state).
#
# This script has two deliberately narrow recovery paths:
#
# 1. For the transaction-block failure above, it runs a migration with the safe
#    DROP+CREATE CONCURRENTLY shape out-of-band, marks it applied, and retries.
#    The recovery is serialized across racing migrators by a dedicated advisory
#    lock (RECOVERY_LOCK_KEY, see acquire_recovery_lock), and it first
#    terminates any orphaned CONCURRENTLY build a prior interrupted deploy left
#    holding the table lock (see terminate_orphaned_concurrently_backends), so
#    the DROP cannot wedge behind it on statement_timeout.
# 2. For the two-statement SET LOCAL lock_timeout + ALTER INDEX ... SET (...)
#    shape, it rolls back Prisma's failed record and retries a bounded number of
#    times through Prisma. It never splits or marks that transactional migration
#    applied itself. The gate is on SHAPE, never on a migration or index name.
#
# Both paths discover the failing migration from Prisma's output and inspect
# prisma/migrations/<name>/migration.sql. Anything matching neither guarded
# recovery path fails loudly.
#
# A P1002 advisory-lock timeout (another session holds Prisma's migration lock,
# usually a migrator container orphaned by a prior interrupted deploy) is NOT a
# migration failure: it is detected separately and printed with cleanup steps,
# never auto-resolved.
#
# This script is COPYed into the image next to prisma/migrations in the same
# build, so it is always version-locked to the migrations it must handle. All
# three call sites (host deploy.sh, image startup CMD, helm initContainer)
# invoke it, so it carries its own step timeout as defense-in-depth (deploy.sh
# also wraps it; the CMD/initContainer paths have no outer timeout).
#
# OUT-OF-BAND RECOVERABLE shape: a migration whose SQL
# contains BOTH a DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY and a CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, so
# re-running it out-of-band is idempotent and clears a half-built INVALID index
# first:
#
#     DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS "x";
#     CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "x" ON ...;
#
# A bare `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (no DROP) is INTENTIONALLY not recovered:
# such migrations (e.g. 20260511000000) are written to fail loudly rather than
# be marked applied with a possibly-INVALID index. They fall through to a loud
# failure here by gate, deterministically.
#
# Statements must end with `;` at end of line, comments must be full-line `--`,
# and `;` must not appear inside string literals (true for all index DDL).

# the next only on its second try, so one retry is a coin flip against a table
# under continuous load.
#
# Each attempt is a `migrate resolve` plus a `migrate deploy`, so two Prisma CLI

# all. Note the budget is PER MIGRATION (the counter resets when the failing

# Orphaned CONCURRENTLY index builds outlive their migrator: PostgreSQL does not
# notice that a client disconnected while a backend is mid-statement
# (client_connection_check_interval defaults to 0), so a CREATE INDEX
# CONCURRENTLY whose migrator container was killed, OOM'd, or timed out keeps
# running and keeps its SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock on the table. The out-of-band
# DROP in recover_migration would then queue behind that lock and be cancelled by
# statement_timeout, wedging every retry until an operator terminates the backend
# by hand. Clear it first so a re-run (e.g. after raising MIGRATION_TIMEOUT for a
# large table) self-heals instead.
#
# Migrator connections set client_connection_check_interval (options rewrite
# above), so a backend whose client cleanly vanished cancels itself within ~10s
# and new orphans of that class should be rare. This kill remains load-bearing
# for what the GUC cannot see: orphans left by pre-GUC migrator versions, and
# half-open connections (migrator node death, network partition) where no FIN
# arrives and only TCP keepalives eventually reap the socket.
#
# Scoped so it cannot touch the app, monitoring, another database on a shared
# cluster, or THIS run's own connections:
#   * datname = current_database() AND usename = current_user — the same DB+role
#     the orphan was created under (its DATABASE_URL is ours), never a sibling
#     environment sharing the cluster. Matches terminate_migrator_backends /
#     health-alert.sh. The role scope CAN skip an orphan created under a
#     since-rotated credential (same DB, different role); that narrow case wedges
#     on statement_timeout exactly as it did before this cleanup existed and
#     still needs a manual pg_terminate_backend.
#   * application_name LIKE '<MIGRATOR_APP_NAME_PREFIX>%' — only this pipeline's
#     migrator identity (the app sets none; monitoring uses 'supersync-monitor'),
#   * application_name <> the current run AND pid <> pg_backend_pid() — never our
#     own session nor the cleanup connection itself,
#   * state = 'active' AND query ILIKE '%CONCURRENTLY%' — only a session ACTIVELY running
#     a concurrent build/drop. The state filter is load-bearing:
#     pg_stat_activity.query keeps showing the LAST statement on an idle session,
#     so without it an idle migrator connection whose previous statement was a
#     CONCURRENTLY build would be a false match.
#
# This kill cannot tell an orphan apart from a PEER run's LIVE build (the
# out-of-band recovery never holds Prisma's advisory lock — that is why a P3018
# on a pending migration is reachable at all), so every caller MUST hold the
# dedicated recovery advisory lock first (acquire_recovery_lock, #9781): with
# recoveries serialized, no peer recovery can be mid-build when this fires.
# The predicate stays as defense-in-depth for what the lock cannot cover: a
# pre-lock migrator version racing this one, an operator running the printed
# manual recovery statements outside the lock, and a run that degraded to
# UNLOCKED after a lock-helper failure — in those windows a live peer build is
# still killable, and the fleet then converges via the idempotent
# drop-then-create at the cost of a wasted rebuild. That trade is why the
# P1002 path still refuses to auto-kill (its lock holder may be a live build
# the operator must adjudicate).
#
# Runs through prisma db execute (not the node cleanup used on timeout), so it
# inherits the same finite statement_timeout and stays fake-able in tests.
# Best-effort: on failure the DROP still runs, so warn and continue.

# Serialize the out-of-band recovery under RECOVERY_LOCK_KEY (#9781), so the
# orphan-kill above can never fire while a PEER recovery is mid-build.
#
# Why a held helper connection: `npx prisma db execute` opens a fresh session
# per statement, so a session-level pg_advisory_lock taken there would vanish
# immediately, and pg_advisory_xact_lock bundled per statement only serializes
# individual statements — a peer could still kill a build between them (and
# bundling would turn CONCURRENTLY DDL into a multi-statement transaction,
# which PostgreSQL forbids). So a small node helper opens ONE PrismaClient
# connection (connection_limit=1 — a session lock lives and dies with its
# session, so the pool must never swap it), polls pg_try_advisory_lock once a
# second up to RECOVERY_LOCK_TIMEOUT (pg_try_* returns a plain boolean; the
# blocking pg_advisory_lock returns void, which Prisma's raw deserializer
# cannot be trusted with), acks through a file, and holds the session until
# SIGTERM. While holding, a 30s heartbeat keeps the pooled connection from
# being reaped idle and re-secures the lock if the pool ever swapped the
# session; the helper also exits when the parent shell is gone, so a holder
# orphaned by a hard kill releases within one beat instead of wedging peers.
# An idle session's death is detected by PostgreSQL immediately (the backend
# is blocked reading the socket), so a killed holder releases the lock at
# once — the mid-statement orphan problem the kill above heals does not apply
# to the holder itself.
#
# Failure split, deliberately asymmetric:
#   * exit 3 (connected, lock still held after the wait) is FATAL for the
#     caller: the holder is a live peer recovery whose CONCURRENTLY build must
#     not be touched — fail loudly with diagnosis guidance and let the
#     orchestrator's restart retry.
#   * any other failure (cannot even connect/start) degrades to an UNLOCKED
#     recovery with a loud warning: Prisma itself just reached the database
#     over the same URL, so this is a helper problem, and refusing to recover
#     would turn every such hiccup into a wedged deploy. Unlocked equals the
#     pre-lock behavior; the kill predicate still bounds what it can touch.

# A lock-bounded migration: exactly two statements, a SET LOCAL lock_timeout
# followed by a single ALTER INDEX ... SET (...). Such a migration needs native
# Prisma transaction semantics (SET LOCAL must apply to the ALTER, and a
# successful native retry must be what records it as applied), and re-running it
# from scratch is free, so a lock timeout can safely be retried.
#
# Gated on SHAPE, never on a migration or index name; absence of names is
# enforced by tests/migration-sql.spec.ts. Rationale: prisma/migrations/README.md.
#
# Three properties are enforced below, and a fourth follows from them:
#   - a SHORT lock_timeout bound (<= 5s). This is the load-bearing one: the point
#     of the bound is to fail fast rather than queue new queries behind a waiting
#     ACCESS EXCLUSIVE request, so a long value ('30min') — or a disabled one
#     ('0', which means wait forever in PostgreSQL) — must never be retried at
#     all, let alone MAX_LOCK_ATTEMPTS times;
#   - exactly two statements, so Postgres wraps them in an implicit transaction
#     and a lock timeout rolls the whole migration back with nothing partially
#     applied;
#   - an ALTER INDEX ... SET (reloption), which is idempotent on re-run.
# The fourth — no CONCURRENTLY — is NOT a separate check: it follows from the
# ALTER pattern being fully anchored with a paren-free option list, so the
# ALTER's own `)` always lands inside the span and nothing can follow it. That
# matters because split_statements breaks on `;` at END OF LINE, so the
# statement count alone would not stop a CONCURRENTLY build sharing the ALTER's
# line — and a SINGLE-statement migration gets no implicit transaction, so a
# lock timeout mid-build leaves an INVALID index a blind retry cannot clear.
#
# Matched with grep -Ei, like the CONCURRENTLY gates above, so that spacing and
# keyword case are not load-bearing for a future migration author.
