        // holding one op newer than the cutoff would be pruned around it and
        // leave a plain delta as the lowest surviving row. Replay then breaks:
        // `_resolveExpectedFirstSeq` (op-replay.ts) tolerates a leading gap ONLY
        // when the lowest surviving op is a causal full-state op that resets
        // state — otherwise it throws SNAPSHOT_REPLAY_INCOMPLETE, which the
        // restore route surfaces as a 500. Skipping the user keeps the whole
        // prefix intact until it ages out, so this sweep never NEWLY breaks the
        // invariant that path documents ("the surviving lowest-seq op is
        // guaranteed to be a full-state op"). Costs retention lag, never
        // over-deletion. Note the invariant is not globally true: quota
        // recovery's deleteOldestRestorePointAndOps deletes up to a restore
        // point and can leave a delta lowest — pre-existing, tracked separately.
        //
        // `orderBy: receivedAt` is load-bearing, not cosmetic. The predicate is a
        // 2D range (`server_seq <` AND `received_at >=`) and no index answers both
        // as search bounds, so one of them is always a filter and the planner is
        // free to pick which. Down `(user_id, server_seq)` a NO answer walks the
        // user's ENTIRE prefix — the deepest histories, which is precisely the
        // cohort this sweep exists to prune, so it fails worst where it matters
        // most and gets worse every day it fails.
        //
        // And the planner could not tell the two apart: MEASURED on PG 16 under
        // force_generic_plan (which is what Prisma's prepared statements get), the
        // two candidates cost BIT-IDENTICALLY — `0.29..32.17 rows=2` each — because
        // both are "equality on user_id plus one range at default selectivity", while
        // one touches 9 buffers and the other 60,329. A tie is settled by internals
        // no version promises to keep stable, so the same statement is instant on one
        // server and fatal on another. That coin flip, not a mis-costing, is the bug.
        //
        // Ordering by receivedAt does not pin the `(user_id, received_at)` path and is
        // not a hint; it removes the tie. That index already emits receivedAt order
        // under an equality qual on user_id, so it sorts for free AND keeps LIMIT-1
        // pushdown (16.23), while `(user_id, server_seq)` must add a blocking Sort and
        // lose the early exit (30.86) — a ~2x margin where there was none. Its NO
        // answer is then bounded by the user's ops inside the retention window: not
        // free — a heavy user's window is still thousands of rows, each costing a heap
        // fetch because server_seq is not in that index — but bounded by activity
        // rather than history depth, which is what makes it stop growing. The full fix
        // is a covering `(user_id, received_at, server_seq)` index (index-only scan,
        // ordering free); left out here because that is a migration on a multi-GB
        // table, not a code change.

   * `findMany({ serverSeq: { lt: boundary }, take: limit })` feeding a
   * `deleteMany` by id — bounded the rows RETURNED but not the rows SCANNED,
   * and production found three independent ways for that scan to blow the 60s
   * `statement_timeout` (#9692):
   *   1. low match density: when few rows below the boundary are older than
   *      the cutoff, the LIMIT never fills and the scan heap-filters the
   *      user's whole prefix (measured: 4x the block cost while deleting
   *      nothing);
   *   2. cold I/O: even at 100% density, `take: 5000` is ~5000 random heap
   *      fetches to check `received_at` — ~48s at the host's measured ~9.5ms
   *      cold reads;
   *   3. dead tuples: a prefix already deleted by quota recovery leaves its
   *      index entries behind until vacuum, and the scan visits every one —
   *      measured 88s / 6,787 cold pages to return zero rows. (How long that
   *      backlog survives is an autovacuum scale factor, tuned per-table in
   *      20260828000003; the measurement above predates it.)
   * A two-sided `serverSeq` range caps the index entries a statement can touch
   * at the window width regardless of match density, tuple liveness, or plan
   * choice, so none of the three can recur. `server_seq` is unique per user,
   * so the width also caps the rows deleted per statement — no `take`, no id
   * round-trip, one statement instead of two.
   *
   * Returns the rows that actually left the table — a window can legitimately
   * delete zero (already pruned, or emptied concurrently by quota recovery,
   * which holds `runWithStorageUsageLock`; this sweep does not) and the caller
   * just advances to the next window.
