# @sp/sync-core

Framework-agnostic primitives for the Super Productivity sync engine: operation-log types, vector clocks, conflict resolution, gzip compression, and end-to-end encryption. Consumed by the main app and the NouraSync server; no Angular/Electron/Capacitor dependencies.

## Encryption

The encryption layer provides Argon2id key derivation and AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption, with a WebCrypto path and an `@noble/ciphers` fallback for environments where `crypto.subtle` is unavailable (notably Android Capacitor on `http://localhost`).

```ts
import {
  encrypt,
  decrypt,
  encryptBatch,
  decryptBatch,
  clearSessionKeyCache,
  setLegacyKdfWarningHandler,
} from '@sp/sync-core';

const cipher = await encrypt('hello', password);
const plain = await decrypt(cipher, password);
```

### Wire format (public contract)

| Format   | Bytes                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Argon2id | `[SALT (16)] [IV (12)] [AES-GCM ciphertext + auth tag (>= 16)]` |
| Legacy   | `[IV (12)] [AES-GCM ciphertext + auth tag (>= 16)]`             |

All ciphertexts are base64-encoded for transport. The format is discriminated by length: `< 28` bytes is invalid, `< 44` bytes is unambiguously legacy, `>= 44` bytes is treated as Argon2id with a legacy fallback on auth failure. Do not change this without a versioning migration.

### Salt and IV semantics

- The **IV** (12 bytes) is freshly random per call. AES-GCM security under a fixed key reduces to IV uniqueness, which this guarantees.
- The **salt** (16 bytes) is derived once per `(process session, password)` pair and reused across every `encrypt`/`encryptBatch` call in that session. This is intentional — it lets the session cache amortize the ~500 ms–2 s Argon2id derivation. Two encryptions of the same plaintext within a session therefore share the salt prefix and differ only in IV and ciphertext. Do not assert per-call salt uniqueness in tests.

### Session key caching

`encrypt`/`decrypt`/`encryptBatch`/`decryptBatch` all share three in-memory caches (encrypt key, decrypt key by salt, legacy PBKDF2 key) that survive across sync cycles. Argon2id derivation is expensive (~500–2000 ms on mobile with the default 64 MiB / 3 iterations); the cache turns repeated syncs from minutes into seconds.

Call `clearSessionKeyCache()` whenever the user changes their password or logs out. Keys live in memory only and are never persisted.

### Legacy-KDF migration

Old data was encrypted with PBKDF2 using the password as its own salt — cryptographically weak. `decrypt()` and `decryptBatch()` still read legacy ciphertexts so existing sync data remains accessible.

`setLegacyKdfWarningHandler(fn)` registers a callback fired on every successful legacy decrypt, regardless of which entry point was used. The host throttles user-facing messages (e.g. show a deprecation banner once per session).

### Argon2id parameters

Defaults are OWASP 2023 mobile guidance (parallelism: 1, iterations: 3, memorySize: 64 MiB). Tests can weaken them via `setArgon2ParamsForTesting({ ... })` — this throws when called with `NODE_ENV === 'production'` in Node bundles. Restore defaults by calling with no argument.
