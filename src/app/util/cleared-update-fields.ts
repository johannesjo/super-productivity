/**
 * Clearing an entity field via an NgRx update dispatches
 * `changes: { someField: undefined }`. That works locally (and in the
 * IndexedDB op-log, which structured-clones the payload), but every JSON
 * serialization of the op — SuperSync HTTP/E2EE, file-based sync providers,
 * the SQLite op-log — drops undefined-valued keys entirely, so the clear
 * replays as a no-op on other devices (issue #9776).
 *
 * Fix pattern: the action creator lists the cleared keys out-of-band via
 * {@link clearedFieldsProps} (a plain string[] survives JSON), and the reducer
 * restores them with {@link applyClearedFields} before handing the changes to
 * the entity adapter. Older clients simply ignore the extra `clearedFields`
 * action prop, so the clear degrades to today's no-op instead of corrupting
 * their state (see sync rule 10 — no schema bump needed).
