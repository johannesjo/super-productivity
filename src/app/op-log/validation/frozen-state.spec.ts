/**
 * Guardrail for "required field added without a migration" (#9125, #9124).
 *
 * `frozen-state-v18.15.json` is persisted app state as written by v18.15. It
 * stands in for the data already sitting on users' disks, so its value is its
 * AGE — do not regenerate it from current defaults, and do not add fields to it
 * to make a failing test pass.
 *
 * WHEN THIS FAILS you made a field required that older data does not carry. Fix
 * the model: type it optional (`?`) — the cheap, preferred answer — or backfill
 * it in a schema migration, which costs a schema bump (see AGENTS.md rule 10).
 * Editing the fixture silences the guard and ships the bug #9124 fixed.
 *
 * A TRANSFORMING MIGRATION IS NOT A REASON TO EDIT THIS FILE. `migrateState`
 * below applies it during the test, and the spec still passing is the proof the
 * migration handles real v18.15 data — the most valuable thing this test does.
 * Hand-editing to the post-migration shape while `__frozenAtSchemaVersion`
 * stays 4 would re-apply the migration to already-migrated data. The only edit
 * ever warranted is re-pinning the version if `MIN_SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`
 * rises above it; then migrate the fixture forward once, or add a new dated
 * fixture alongside — never regenerate this one from `createValidAppData()`.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE IS BULKY: typia checks a TYPE, and it cannot check a type
 * whose only instances live in an empty collection. Every populated collection
 * here buys coverage of one more persisted model, so keep them non-empty (the
 * `no vacuous collections` spec below enforces that). Known limits: `validateFull`
 * omits `archiveOld`/`archiveYoung` (`DataToValidate` in validation-fn.ts), so
 * they are validated separately below; nothing checks types that appear nowhere
 * in the fixture at all.
 *
 * NOTE: `migrateState` is a no-op while `__frozenAtSchemaVersion` equals
 * `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` — it goes live at the next bump, and a bump shipped
 * without a migration fails here with "No migration path from version N".
 *
 * ⚠️ Locally this spec can pass on a STALE validator. typia inlines the whole
 * model graph into `validation-fn.ts`, but Angular's build cache does not
 * invalidate that file when a type it only *imports* changes — so right after
 * editing a model, a warm-cache run still validates against the old shape and
 * reports zero errors. CI builds cold and is unaffected. To check a model change
 * locally, clear the cache first: `rm -rf .angular/cache`. Clearing only the
 * `babel-webpack` namespace is NOT enough — verified: the typia output is cached
 * under `angular-webpack`, and the narrower clear still reports a green false
 * negative against a model that genuinely broke the fixture.
 *
 * @see AGENTS.md — Sync-correctness rule 11
