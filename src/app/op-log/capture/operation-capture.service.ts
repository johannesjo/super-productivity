/**
 * Tracks how many local actions have been captured but not yet written to the
 * operation log, and computes the `entityChanges` payload for an action.
 *
 * ## Pending counter (replaces the former positional FIFO queue)
 *
 * The meta-reducer increments the counter synchronously when it captures a
 * local action; the persist effect decrements it in a `finally` after each
 * write attempt completes (success OR failure). `flushPendingWrites()` polls
 * `getPendingCount()` to know when every dispatched action has been processed.
 *
 * The previous implementation kept a FIFO of `EntityChange[]` correlated with
 * actions purely by position (meta-reducer `push`, effect `shift`). That
 * positional contract leaked an entry whenever a write threw before its
 * dequeue ran (e.g. a lock-acquisition timeout), permanently wedging the flush
 * — issue #8306. A plain counter decremented in a `finally` cannot leak.
 *
 * ## entityChanges extraction
 *
 * `extractEntityChanges()` is a pure function of the action — there is no state
 * diffing. It returns `[]` for every action except `TIME_TRACKING` and the
 * `[TimeTracking] Sync time spent` TASK action, whose reducers don't follow the
 * standard entity-adapter pattern. The field is kept on the wire (even as `[]`)
 * because the Android background provider reads `payload.entityChanges` for
 * reminder scheduling and the `isMultiEntityPayload` guard requires it; replay
 * and conflict detection use `actionPayload` / `meta.entityId` only.
