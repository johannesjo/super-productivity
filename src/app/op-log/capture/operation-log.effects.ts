   * Reachability (#8751): the store's `_handleAppendError` wraps only the
   * standard `QuotaExceededError` name into `StorageQuotaExceededError extends
   * Error`, which never matches here — so on Chromium the quota branch below is
   * effectively dead and real quota failures take the generic
   * mark-divergence-and-reload path. The two legacy spellings below are NOT
   * wrapped, so they still arrive as raw DOMExceptions and do reach
   * `handleQuotaExceeded`. There, `emergencyCompact()` now always returns false:
   * it is called from the failing write's own stack, so that write is still
   * counted pending and the phantom-change guard skips the snapshot. Net effect
   * is the same reload prompt, just via a wasted compaction attempt. Do not
   * "simplify" this on the assumption that quota handling is unreachable — see
   * #9082 (delete-only emergency compaction), which is what would make freeing
   * space possible without baking a phantom change.
