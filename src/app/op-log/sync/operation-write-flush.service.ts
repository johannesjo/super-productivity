/**
 * Service to ensure all pending operation writes have completed.
 *
 * Used by sync to guarantee conflict detection sees all local operations.
 * This prevents race conditions where an action is dispatched but the
 * corresponding operation hasn't been written to IndexedDB yet.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * ### Two-Phase Wait Strategy
 *
 * **Phase 1: Wait for the pending counter to reach 0**
 * The NgRx effect uses `concatMap` for sequential processing. The meta-reducer
 * increments OperationCaptureService's pending counter synchronously when it
 * captures an action; the effect decrements it (in a `finally`) after each write
 * attempt completes. We poll the counter until it reaches 0, meaning all
 * dispatched actions have been processed by the effect.
 *
 * **Phase 2: Acquire Write Lock**
 * Once the counter is drained, we acquire the same lock used by `writeOperation()`.
 * This ensures the final write has completed its IndexedDB transaction.
 *
 * This two-phase approach handles the case where many actions are dispatched rapidly
 * and the RxJS concatMap pipeline is still processing them.
