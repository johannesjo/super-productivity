/**
 * Session-scoped latch that records whether post-sync state validation
 * failed at any point during the current sync session.
 *
 * A "sync session" is a single top-level sync operation:
 * - `SyncWrapperService._sync()`
 * - `WsTriggeredDownloadService._drainPending()`
 * - `ImmediateUploadService._performUpload()`
 *
 * The USE_REMOTE branch in `SyncWrapperService._handleLocalDataConflict`
 * is *not* an entry point — it runs inside `_sync()`'s session and uses
 * `reset()` for sub-scope re-scoping (see the `reset()` docs below).
 *
 * These entry points are serialised by the wrapper's global lock, so a
 * single mutable boolean is safe — there is never more than one session
 * active at a time.
 *
 * ## Why a latch instead of typed return plumbing?
 *
 * Validation runs in several places (`RemoteOpsProcessingService.validateAfterSync`,
 * `ConflictResolutionService._validateAndRepairAfterResolution`, etc.) called
 * from many code paths (download, upload, piggyback, retry, USE_REMOTE force
 * download). Threading a `validationFailed: boolean` through every result type
 * meant adding the field to seven discriminated-union variants and remembering
 * to forward it at every junction. A new variant or call site that forgot to
 * carry the flag would silently let `IN_SYNC` ride over corrupt state.
 *
 * The latch collapses that to: validation site flips it, wrapper reads it
 * once before deciding `IN_SYNC` vs `ERROR`. Issue #7330.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * - Every sync entry point wraps its work in `withSession()`. The wrapper
 *   resets the latch up-front and clears the session marker on completion.
 * - `setFailed()` is called by validation sites when state is corrupt.
 *   Outside an active session it logs an error (programming-error guard) but
 *   still flips the flag so we err on the side of surfacing the failure.
 * - `hasFailed()` is read by the wrapper before claiming IN_SYNC.
 *
 * ## Why `withSession` instead of `reset()` + `try/finally`?
 *
 * The previous API had a "remember to call reset() before doing work"
 * contract enforced only by code review. A new entry point that forgot the
 * reset would inherit a leaked-failed latch from a prior session. The
 * callback form makes the session boundary unambiguous and self-clearing,
 * and lets us assert "no nested sessions" — a re-entry that would silently
 * clobber the outer session's state.
