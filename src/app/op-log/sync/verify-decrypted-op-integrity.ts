/**
 * Verifies that a just-decrypted operation's UNAUTHENTICATED metadata is
 * consistent with its AUTHENTICATED payload.
 *
 * SuperSync E2EE (AES-256-GCM) covers only `op.payload`; every other field —
 * `entityId`, `opType`, `actionType`, `vectorClock`, `timestamp`,
 * `isPayloadEncrypted`, ... — travels as plaintext beside the ciphertext and is
 * NOT bound by the GCM auth tag (no Additional Authenticated Data). A
 * malicious/compromised sync server or a TLS MITM therefore cannot read or
 * forge payload *contents*, but it CAN tamper with the metadata.
 * GHSA-8pxh-mgc7-gp3g.
 *
 * This is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH that closes one vector: retagging an *encrypted*
 * LWW-update op with a different `entityId` to redirect the (authenticated)
 * changes onto an attacker-chosen entity. `convertOpToAction()` would otherwise
 * resolve the mismatch by trusting the tampered `op.entityId` over the
 * authenticated `payload.id` (it coerces `payload.id = op.entityId` — including
 * when `payload.id` is absent — and only warns). Here we treat the
 * authenticated `payload.id` as ground truth and fail CLOSED: an in-scope LWW op
 * whose authenticated payload does not carry a string `id` equal to
 * `op.entityId` is rejected. The gate mirrors `convertOpToAction`'s coercion
 * predicate exactly (same alias resolution, same singleton exclusion) so the two
 * boundaries cannot drift and leave a hole.
 *
 * Semantic `restoreTask` operations are also bound to their authenticated task
 * id, TASK entity type, and UPDATE op type because conflict resolution preserves
 * their action type and payload for archive cleanup.
 *
 * Scope: only encrypted ops reach this boundary (it is called from the decrypt
 * path), so unencrypted ops — where neither side is authenticated and the
 * #7330 producer-drift coercion still legitimately applies — are unaffected.
 *
 * NOTE: interim hardening only. The plaintext-injection downgrade (a forged op
 * with `isPayloadEncrypted=false` that would skip decryption AND this check) is
 * handled separately by `assertOpsEncryptedWhenExpected` at the download
 * boundary. Full-state `opType` promotion is handled below by
 * `assertDecryptedFullStateOpIntegrity`. Still OPEN pending the durable fix
 * (bind metadata as GCM AAD behind an envelope-versioned migration):
 *  - Within-LWW `entityType`/`actionType` swap (ids left equal so this passes).
 *  - `vectorClock`/`timestamp` reorder/replay.
 * See GHSA-8pxh-mgc7-gp3g and
 * docs/sync-and-op-log/supersync-encryption-architecture.md.
 *
 * @throws OperationIntegrityError when tampering is detected.
