 * It handles uploading local changes, downloading remote changes, detecting conflicts,
 * and ensuring data consistency across all clients.

 * ## Sync Flow

 * ```
 *
 * ## Key Concepts
 *
 * ### Piggybacked Operations
 * When uploading, the server may return ops from other clients in the same response.
 * These are processed BEFORE marking rejected ops so conflict detection works properly.
 *
 * ### Non-Conflicting Ops Piggybacking
 * When conflicts are detected, non-conflicting ops are passed to ConflictResolutionService
 * to be applied together with resolved conflicts. This ensures dependency sorting works
 * (e.g., Task depends on Project from a resolved conflict).
 *
 * ### Fresh Client Safety
 * A client with no history must download before uploading to prevent overwriting
 * valid remote data with empty state. Fresh clients also see a confirmation dialog.
 *
 * ## Delegated Services
 * - **OperationLogUploadService**: Handles server communication for uploads
 * - **OperationLogDownloadService**: Handles server communication for downloads
 * - **ConflictResolutionService**: Presents conflicts to user and applies resolutions
 * - **VectorClockService**: Manages vector clock state and entity frontiers
 * - **OperationApplierService**: Applies operations to NgRx store
 * - **ValidateStateService**: Validates and repairs state after sync (Checkpoint D)
