/**
 * Fails closed when a mandatory-encryption op stream contains a PLAINTEXT op.
 *
 * The `isPayloadEncrypted` flag is itself unauthenticated plaintext metadata
 * (GHSA-8pxh-mgc7-gp3g). A compromised SuperSync server or a MITM can set it to
 * `false` and supply a fully attacker-authored plaintext op. Such an op skips
 * decryption AND the post-decrypt payload/metadata integrity checks entirely
 * and is applied verbatim —
 * arbitrary op forgery on an encryption-mandatory client, strictly more powerful
 * than retagging a genuine ciphertext op.
 *
 * Why rejecting is safe (no legit plaintext to lose): SuperSync makes encryption
 * mandatory, and enabling it re-uploads all data encrypted after deleting the
 * server copy (`SuperSyncEncryptionToggleService.enableEncryption` →
 * `deleteAndReuploadWithNewEncryption`). So once encryption is active, NO
 * legitimate plaintext op remains on the server; any inbound plaintext op is
 * stale or injected → reject the whole batch (fail closed).
 *
 * This is the SuperSync op-level mirror of the file-based download guard
 * (GHSA-vrc7) and the `EncryptNoPasswordError` upload guard (GHSA-9544). Callers
 * must scope `isEncryptionExpected` to the mandatory-encryption provider
 * (`isEncryptionMandatory`) with encryption enabled in config
 * (`isEncryptionEnabled()`, NOT key presence — the key can be transiently gone
 * in the dropped-credential state while encryption is still mandatory).
 * File-snapshot providers have different, non-mandatory semantics and their own
 * download guard, and a never-encrypted SuperSync account
 * (`isEncryptionEnabled() === false`) legitimately carries plaintext.
 *
 * @throws OperationIntegrityError if any op is not flagged encrypted.
