/**
 * SPAP-14 — Pure disjoint-field auto-merge logic.
 *
 * When two clients concurrently edit the SAME entity but DIFFERENT (non-noise)
 * fields, whole-entity LWW would discard one side's real edit. SPAP-14 instead
 * KEEPS BOTH by synthesizing a single merged UPDATE whose delta is the union of
 * both sides' changed fields.
 *
 * No Angular, no I/O — deterministic, so the merge decision and the synthesized
 * changes delta are unit-testable in isolation. Determinism is the whole point:
 * both clients must arrive at the byte-identical merged delta regardless of
 * which one performs the merge (see `synthesizeMergedChanges`).
