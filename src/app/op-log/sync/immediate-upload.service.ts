/**
 * Uploads operations to SuperSync immediately after they're persisted to IndexedDB.
 *
 * This service provides near-real-time sync by uploading operations as they happen,
 * rather than waiting for periodic sync triggers. Features:
 *
 * - 100ms debounce to batch rapid operations
 * - Silent failure (normal sync will pick up pending ops)
 * - Handles piggybacked operations from server responses
 *
 * ## Checkmark (IN_SYNC) behavior
 *
 * The sync checkmark is ONLY shown when the server confirms there are no pending
 * remote operations (i.e., piggybackedOps is empty). This ensures the checkmark
 * accurately represents "fully in sync" state:
 *
 * - Upload succeeds + no piggybacked ops → Show checkmark (confirmed in sync)
 * - Upload succeeds + piggybacked ops exist → Process them, but NO checkmark
 *   (there may be more remote ops; let normal sync confirm full sync)
 *
 * Guards:
 * - Only uploads when online
 * - Only uploads when SuperSync (OperationSyncCapable) is active
 * - Skips when full sync is in progress
 * - Skips for fresh clients (no history)
