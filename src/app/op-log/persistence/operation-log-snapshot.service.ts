   * Saves the current NgRx state as a snapshot for faster future loads.

   * Runs via flushThenRunExclusive (#8469): the capture pipeline is drained
   * BEFORE the OPERATION_LOG lock is taken and the pending counter re-checked
   * once inside it, so no counted action can be dispatched-but-unsequenced at
   * the capture point. NgRx state mutates synchronously at dispatch while the
   * op's seq is only assigned later in the persist effect — without the
   * quiesce, an op whose reducer had already run but whose seq-write was
   * still queued behind the lock would be baked into the snapshot state AND
   * tail-replayed on the next boot, double-applying non-idempotent reducers
   * (accumulating time/metric deltas, plain-append list branches).
   *
   * Deferred actions (buffered during a sync window, kept across windows
   * after a failed drain) are NOT covered by the pending counter; they are
   * handled by an explicit skip inside the body.
   *
   * Inside the lock, state is read first — synchronously, before any await
   * can let a dispatch interleave — and lastSeq after. While the lock is held
   * no new seq can be assigned, so every op with seq <= lastAppliedOpSeq has
   * its effect in the captured state, and any later dispatch is absent from
   * it and replays cleanly. This order relies on EVERY seq-assigning writer
   * holding the OPERATION_LOG lock (persist effect, remote apply, repair,
   * server migration — all do): a writer bypassing the lock would degrade
   * this window to silent op-LOSS, strictly worse than the pre-quiesce
   * re-replay bias.
   *
   * Failure (flush timeout, persistent dispatch activity) only skips the
   * save: the snapshot is a boot-time cache and the op-log stays the source
   * of truth.
   *
   * @returns Whether a snapshot was actually written. `false` means a guard
   *   skipped it or the write failed — callers that branch on "is the on-disk
   *   cache now current?" MUST use this rather than assuming resolution implies
   *   a write (the hydrator's post-migration convergence gate does).
