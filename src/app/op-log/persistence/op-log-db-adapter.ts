/**
 * Backend-agnostic persistence port for the op-log subsystem.
 *
 * Phase A of the SQLite migration (see docs/sync-and-op-log/sqlite-migration.md).
 * The op-log store currently talks to `idb` directly; this port lets the same
 * store run over either IndexedDB (web/PWA/Electron) or native SQLite
 * (Capacitor iOS/Android) without leaking either engine's semantics.
 *
 * Design constraints captured from the existing IndexedDB store:
 * - `ops` uses an auto-increment integer key (`seq`), a UNIQUE index on
 *   `op.id` (`byId`), a plain index on `syncedAt`, and a compound index on
 *   `[source, applicationStatus]`.
 * - Singleton stores (`vector_clock`, `client_id`, `state_cache`,
 *   `import_backup`, archive) are keyed by a known string key.
 * - Two flows require atomic multi-store writes:
 *   `appendWithVectorClockOverwrite` (OPS + VECTOR_CLOCK) and
 *   `runDestructiveStateReplacement` (OPS + STATE_CACHE + VECTOR_CLOCK +
 *   CLIENT_ID + archive). Hence the callback-based {@link transaction}: commit
 *   on resolve, roll back on throw — the one shape both IDB auto-commit and
 *   SQLite BEGIN/COMMIT map onto cleanly.

 *   pattern the op-log store uses to prune full-state ops);
