/**
 * Adapter that enables file-based sync providers (WebDAV, Dropbox, LocalFile)
 * to support operation-log sync.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * This adapter wraps a file-based provider and implements `OperationSyncCapable`,
 * allowing the unified sync system to work with file storage instead of APIs.
 *
 * ## Single File Approach
 * All sync data is stored in `sync-data.json`:
 * - Full state snapshot (for bootstrapping and recovery)
 * - Recent operations (for conflict detection and merging)
 * - Vector clock (for causality tracking)
 * - syncVersion counter (for optimistic locking)
 *
 * ## Conflict Resolution
 * Unlike PFAPI's model-level conflicts, this approach enables entity-level
 * conflict resolution using the operations in `recentOps`. When two clients
 * modify different entities, both changes are preserved.
 *
 * ## Content-Based Optimistic Locking
 * Instead of relying on server ETags (which vary by WebDAV implementation),
 * we use a `syncVersion` counter inside the file itself. On upload:
 * 1. Download current file to get syncVersion
 * 2. If syncVersion !== expected, conflict detected → merge and retry
 * 3. If match, increment syncVersion and upload
 *
 * @see FileBasedSyncData for the file schema
