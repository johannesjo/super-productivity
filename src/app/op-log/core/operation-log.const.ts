 * ## Known Scalability Notes
 *
 * - Bulk hydration (bulk-hydration.meta-reducer.ts): Synchronous loop not tested at 10K+ scale
 * - Compaction deleteOpsWhere: O(N) cursor scan, could be slow with large logs
 *
 * ## Related Timing Constants in Other Files
 *
 * **Sync Configuration** (`src/app/imex/sync/sync.const.ts`):
 * - SYNC_MIN_INTERVAL (5s) - Minimum interval between sync operations
 * - SYNC_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS (40s) - Max wait for ongoing sync to complete
 * - INITIAL_SYNC_DELAY_MS (500ms) - Delay before triggering initial sync
 *
 * **Meta Sync Lock** (`src/app/sync/providers/webdav/webdav.ts`):
 * - LOCK_TTL_MS (5 min) - Lock TTL for distributed lock on remote metadata (WebDAV)
