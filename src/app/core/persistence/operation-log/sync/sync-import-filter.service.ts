/**
 * Service responsible for filtering operations invalidated by SYNC_IMPORT, BACKUP_IMPORT, or REPAIR operations.
 *
 * ## The Problem
 * ```
 * Timeline:
 *   Client A creates ops → Client B does SYNC_IMPORT → Client A syncs
 *
 * Result:
 *   - Client A's ops have higher serverSeq than SYNC_IMPORT
 *   - But they reference entities that were WIPED by the import
 *   - Applying them causes "Task not found" errors
 * ```
 *
 * ## The Solution: Clean Slate Semantics
 * SYNC_IMPORT and BACKUP_IMPORT are explicit user actions to restore ALL clients
 * to a specific state. ALL operations without knowledge of the import are dropped:
 *
 * - **GREATER_THAN / EQUAL**: Op was created with knowledge of import → KEEP
 * - **CONCURRENT**: Op was created without knowledge of import → DROP
 * - **LESS_THAN**: Op is dominated by import → DROP
 *
 * This ensures a true "restore to point in time" semantic. Concurrent work from
 * other clients is intentionally discarded because the user explicitly chose to
 * reset all state to the imported snapshot.
 *
 * We use vector clock comparison (not UUIDv7 timestamps) because vector clocks
 * track CAUSALITY (did the client know about the import?) rather than wall-clock
 * time (which can be affected by clock drift).

   * ## Vector Clock Comparison Results
   * | Comparison     | Meaning                              | Action  |
   * |----------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
   * | GREATER_THAN   | Op created after seeing import       | ✅ Keep |
   * | EQUAL          | Same causal history as import        | ✅ Keep |
   * | LESS_THAN      | Op dominated by import               | ❌ Filter|
   * | CONCURRENT     | Op created without knowledge of import| ❌ Filter|
   *
   * CONCURRENT ops are filtered even if they come from a client the import
   * didn't know about. This ensures a true "restore to point in time" semantic.
   *
   * The import can be in the current batch OR in the local store from a
   * previous sync cycle. We check both to handle the case where old ops from
   * another client arrive after we already downloaded the import.
   *
   * @param ops - Operations to filter (already migrated)
   * @returns Object with `validOps` and `invalidatedOps` arrays
