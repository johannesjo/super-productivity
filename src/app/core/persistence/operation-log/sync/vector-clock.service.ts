/**
 * Service for managing vector clocks in the operation log system.
 *
 * ## What Vector Clocks Represent
 *
 * A vector clock is a map of `{ clientId: counter }` entries that tracks
 * the causal history of operations. Each client increments its own counter
 * when creating operations, allowing us to determine:
 * - Which operations happened before others (causality)
 * - Which operations are concurrent (potential conflicts)
 * - Whether a state is up-to-date with respect to another
 *
 * ## Types of Vector Clocks
 *
 * 1. **Global Vector Clock**: The merged clock from the snapshot plus all
 *    subsequent operations. Represents "everything this client knows about".
 *    Use for: Determining overall sync state, generating new operation clocks.
 *
 * 2. **Entity Frontier**: Per-entity vector clocks tracking the latest
 *    operation for each entity. More granular than global clock.
 *    Use for: Conflict detection on specific entities.
 *
 * ## Effect of Compaction
 *
 * When operations are compacted into a snapshot:
 * - The snapshot stores the global vector clock at compaction time
 * - Individual operation vector clocks are lost (ops are deleted)
 * - Entity frontiers before compaction are approximated by the snapshot clock
 *
 * This means after compaction, we lose per-entity granularity for older
 * operations. The snapshot clock serves as a conservative baseline.
