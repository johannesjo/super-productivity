/**
 * Unified effect for all archive-affecting operations.
 *
 * This effect routes all local archive-affecting actions through ArchiveOperationHandler,
 * making it the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for archive storage operations.
 *
 * ## How It Works
 *
 * - Uses LOCAL_ACTIONS to only process local user actions (not remote sync operations)
 * - Filters actions using isArchiveAffectingAction() helper
 * - Delegates all archive logic to ArchiveOperationHandler.handleOperation()
 *
 * ## Why LOCAL_ACTIONS (Not Actions)
 *
 * Archive operations need different handling for local vs remote actions:
 *
 * - LOCAL actions: This effect calls ArchiveOperationHandler.handleOperation()
 * - REMOTE actions: OperationApplierService calls ArchiveOperationHandler.handleOperation() directly
 *
 * If we used `Actions` (all actions), remote operations would be processed TWICE:
 * 1. Explicitly by OperationApplierService (correct)
 * 2. By this effect (duplicate!)
 *
 * Using LOCAL_ACTIONS ensures exactly one code path handles each archive operation.
 *
 * ## Operation Flow
 *
 * ```
 * LOCAL OPERATIONS:
 * User action -> Reducers -> This effect -> ArchiveOperationHandler.handleOperation()
 *
 * REMOTE OPERATIONS:
 * OperationApplierService -> dispatch() -> Reducers
 *                         \-> ArchiveOperationHandler.handleOperation() (explicit call)
 *                             (this effect is skipped via LOCAL_ACTIONS filter)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Historical Context
 *
 * Previously, archive operations were scattered across multiple effect files:
 * - archive.effects.ts - flushYoungToOld, restoreTask
 * - project.effects.ts - deleteProject archive cleanup
 * - tag.effects.ts - deleteTag/deleteTags archive cleanup
 * - task-repeat-cfg.effects.ts - deleteTaskRepeatCfg archive cleanup
 * - unlink-all-tasks-on-provider-deletion.effects.ts - deleteIssueProvider cleanup
 *
 * This unified effect consolidates all archive handling to eliminate duplicate code
 * between local effects and remote operation handling.
 *
 * @see ArchiveOperationHandler for list of supported archive-affecting actions
 * @see isArchiveAffectingAction for the action filtering logic
 * @see OperationApplierService for how remote operations call the handler directly
