## 1. Tombstone System (Rule 3.5) - DEFERRED

**Priority:** MEDIUM (was HIGH)
**Complexity:** HIGH
**Status:** Evaluated December 2025 - Not currently required

### Evaluation Summary

After comprehensive analysis, tombstones are **not currently needed**. The existing system provides sufficient safeguards:

1. **Event-sourced deletes:** Delete operations are immutable events in the log, not destructive
2. **Conflict detection works:** Vector clocks detect concurrent delete+update; user resolution UI presented
3. **Tag sanitization (Dec 2025):** Recently added fixes filter non-existent task IDs at reducer level
4. **Auto-repair handles orphans:** Invalid states are detected and repaired with REPAIR operations
5. **Archive data preserved:** `moveToArchive` is an UPDATE op, not DELETE - historical data kept

### Current Safeguards Against Delete Conflicts

| Mechanism        | Location                                | What It Does                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Vector clocks    | `conflict-resolution.service.ts`        | Detects concurrent ops, presents to user        |
| Delete heuristic | `operation-log-sync.service.ts:524-540` | Delete vs Update → prefers preserving data      |
| Tag sanitization | `tag-shared.reducer.ts`                 | Filters non-existent taskIds (9a6bc139a)        |
| Subtask cascade  | `task-shared-crud.reducer.ts`           | Includes subtasks in delete cleanup (bf3a386cf) |
| Auto-repair      | `validate-state.service.ts`             | Removes orphaned references, creates REPAIR op  |

### Why Not Implement Now

- No critical data loss scenarios identified in integration tests
- Recent tag sanitization fixes prove system can self-heal
- Cross-version sync (A.7.11) is the real blocker - tombstones don't solve that
- Schema changes for tombstone fields would affect all entity models

### When to Revisit

- **Cross-version sync needed:** When `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION > 1` and clients may run different app versions
- **Undo/restore feature requested:** Tombstones enable recovery of deleted entities
- **Audit compliance required:** If explicit "entity deleted at time X" records needed
- **Performance issues:** If delete ops cause sync bottleneck on high-churn datasets

### Original Proposed Changes (For Future Reference)

If tombstones become necessary:

- Add `isDeleted`, `deletedAt` fields to Task, Project, Tag models
- Update delete reducers to mark as deleted instead of removing
- Add compaction service to clean old tombstones after retention window (suggested 30 days)
- Update selectors to filter out tombstoned entities
- Add recovery/undo functions

## 2. ~~Refactor Move Operations to Relative Positioning~~ ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** COMPLETED (December 2025)
**Approach:** Anchor-based positioning (Option B)

### Implementation Summary

All task drag-drop move operations now use anchor-based positioning (`afterTaskId`) instead of full list replacement (`newOrderedIds`). This makes concurrent moves much more sync-friendly.

#### Completed Actions

**Keyboard/button-triggered moves** (use only `taskId`):

- ✅ `moveProjectTaskUpInBacklogList`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskDownInBacklogList`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToTopInBacklogList`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToBottomInBacklogList`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToBacklogListAuto`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToRegularListAuto`

**Drag-drop moves** (now use anchor-based `afterTaskId`):

- ✅ `moveProjectTaskInBacklogList` - `{ taskId, afterTaskId, workContextId }`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToBacklogList` - `{ taskId, afterTaskId, workContextId }`
- ✅ `moveProjectTaskToRegularList` - `{ taskId, afterTaskId, workContextId, src, target }`
- ✅ `moveTaskInTodayList` - `{ taskId, afterTaskId, workContextId, workContextType, src, target }`

#### Helper Functions (`work-context-meta.helper.ts`)

- `moveItemAfterAnchor(itemId, afterItemId, currentList)` - Anchor-based list reordering
- `getAnchorFromDragDrop(itemId, newOrderedIds)` - Extracts anchor from drag-drop event

#### Edge Cases Handled

- **Move to start**: `afterTaskId === null` → prepend to list
- **Move to DONE section**: `afterTaskId === null && target === 'DONE'` → append to end
- **Deleted anchor**: If anchor not found, fallback to append at end
- **Works across contexts**: Both PROJECT and TAG contexts handle moves consistently

#### Tests Added

- 24 tests in `project.reducer.spec.ts` (anchor-based moves + DONE section handling)
- 12 tests in `tag.reducer.spec.ts` (anchor-based moves for tags)

### Remaining Actions (low priority - infrequent operations)

- `updateProjectOrder` - Project list reordering (rarely used)
- `updateTagOrder` - Tag list reordering (rarely used)

## 3. Slim Down `moveToArchive` Payload

**Priority:** MEDIUM → DEFERRED
**Complexity:** HIGH (requires architectural changes)

### Current State

```typescript
moveToArchive: (taskProps: { tasks: TaskWithSubTasks[] })
```

Sends full task objects (5-50 KB per operation).

### Analysis (December 2025)

After investigation, the full payload is **intentionally required**:

1. **Remote sync needs full data**: When a client receives `moveToArchive`, it must write the tasks to its local archive storage (archiveYoung). The originating client has already removed tasks from its active state.

2. **Sync timing mismatch**: Operations sync immediately, but archiveYoung syncs daily. If we only sent task IDs, receiving clients couldn't look up the task data.

3. **Offline-first design**: A client may receive operations after being offline. The full payload ensures archive data is available even without recent archiveYoung sync.

### Potential Future Optimization

To reduce payload size would require architectural changes:

- Sync archiveYoung before sending moveToArchive operations
- Or implement "archive data fetch on demand" for receiving clients
- Or use a reference-based system where archive data is fetched separately

### Decision

Keep current implementation. The full payload is a deliberate design choice for sync reliability. The 5-50 KB per archive operation is acceptable given archive operations are infrequent (typically once per day at end-of-day).

## 4. ~~Slim Down `deleteProject` Payload~~ ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** COMPLETED (December 2025)

### Implementation

Changed from:

```typescript
deleteProject: (taskProps: { project: Project; allTaskIds: string[] })
```

To:

```typescript
deleteProject: (taskProps: { projectId: string; noteIds: string[]; allTaskIds: string[] })
```

- Reduced payload from full `Project` object (5-20 KB) to just IDs
- `noteIds` is required by note.reducer.ts to delete associated notes
- Updated all reducers, effects, and tests

---

## Implementation Order Recommendation

1. ~~**Tombstones**~~ - DEFERRED: current safeguards sufficient (see Item 1 evaluation above)
2. ~~**Move operations**~~ ✅ - Completed December 2025 (anchor-based positioning)
3. ~~**moveToArchive**~~ - Deferred: full payload required for sync reliability
4. ~~**deleteProject**~~ ✅ - Completed December 2025
5. ~~**Server Sync**~~ ✅ - Completed December 2025 (single-version sync)
6. **Cross-Schema Sync (A.7.11)** - HIGH priority when `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION > 1`

> **Note:** All major sync infrastructure is complete. The remaining HIGH priority item is A.7.11 (conflict-aware operation migration) which becomes critical when schema migrations are needed. Tombstones were evaluated and deferred - the event-sourced architecture plus recent tag sanitization fixes provide sufficient delete conflict handling.
