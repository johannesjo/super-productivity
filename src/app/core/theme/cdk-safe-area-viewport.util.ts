/**
 * Teach CDK about the native mobile insets, so connected overlays (menus,
 * selects, autocomplete panels) stay clear of the system bars and of the iOS
 * keyboard when the WebView does not shrink.
 *
 * Hooks the per-side *viewport margin* getters, CDK's own mechanism for
 * "keep overlays this far from the viewport edge" (`withViewportMargin`), and
 * not the viewport rect (`_getNarrowedViewportRect`). CDK derives the
 * container-relative CSS `bottom` of a bottom-anchored bounding box as
 * `viewport.height - origin.y + marginTop + marginBottom`, i.e. it adds the
 * margins back to return to full-viewport coordinates. Shrinking the rect
 * without declaring margins understates that `bottom` by `top + bottom` (both
 * insets, since both came off `viewport.height`), which pins an
 * 'above'-anchored panel's bottom edge that far *below* its trigger, i.e. down
 * into the very strip being reserved (#8792).
 *
 * The pin is independent of panel height, so a taller menu grows upward and
 * overlaps by exactly as much: with a 48px status bar and a 48px navigation
 * bar, measured on the real app, the panel's bottom sat ~3px above the screen
 * edge whether the menu had one item or two.
 *
 * Declaring margins instead makes the two terms cancel
 * (`(height - top - bottom) - origin.y + top + bottom`), which is why the
 * placement is then correct for any inset combination.
 *
 * Idempotent: patching twice would add the inset twice.
