/**
 * Regression: transient download failure during rejected-ops resolution must
 * NOT permanently drop the user's pending local edit. (#8331)
 *
 * Background: when an upload is rejected with CONFLICT_CONCURRENT, the client
 * downloads remote ops to resolve the conflict. A network blip during that
 * nested download used to call markRejected() on the still-pending local op —
 * which is terminal (rejectedAt is never cleared), so the edit stayed applied
 * locally but never reached other devices. The fix leaves the op pending so it
 * re-resolves on the next sync.
 *
 * Discriminator: after the blip, the exact CONFLICT_CONCURRENT op must still be
 * pending. With the bug, the catch called markRejected() on that op. End-to-end:
 * once the fault clears, B's edit resolves and both clients converge to the
 * same title; with the bug B's edit is dropped and the clients diverge.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - super-sync-server running on localhost:1901 with TEST_MODE=true
 * - Frontend running on localhost:4242
 *
 * Run with: npm run e2e:supersync:file e2e/tests/sync/supersync-rejected-ops-transient-download-8331.spec.ts

      // 5. Arm B's network with three phase-distinguished faults so the

      //    fix guards fire deterministically.
      //
      //    The sync engine downloads before it uploads (sync-wrapper.service:
      //    downloadRemoteOps → uploadPendingOps). A's concurrent op is now on
      //    the server, so B's pre-upload download would normally deliver it, B
      //    would MERGE it, and B would then upload a dominating op the server
      //    ACCEPTS (200) — the rejection path is never reached. So we strip that
      //    pre-upload download (a).
      //
      //    But stripping the download alone is NOT enough, and that is what kept
      //    this test red on every CI run (abortedResolutionGets stayed 0 — see
      //    run 27469179025). With the download stripped, B's upload IS rejected
      //    CONFLICT_CONCURRENT as intended — but the ops-upload conflict comes
      //    back as HTTP 200 whose body carries `results[].errorCode ===
      //    'CONFLICT_CONCURRENT'` (NOT a 409 — only /api/sync/snapshot uses 409),
      //    and that same body PIGGYBACKS the conflicting remote op in `newOps`.
      //    The upload service applies those piggybacked ops and LWW-resolves the
      //    conflict in-place (operation-log-upload.service.ts), so by the time
      //    handleRejectedOps() runs, B's op is already resolved: the separate
      //    resolution-download (RejectedOpsHandlerService._resolveConcurrent-
      //    Modifications → downloadCallback, the GET the #8331 fix guards) is
      //    never issued. We therefore also strip `newOps` from the rejection
      //    body (b): with no piggybacked ops to resolve from, the client falls
      //    back to the resolution-download GET — which we then abort (c).
      //
      //    (Stripping `newOps` is not a contrived path: the server only
      //    piggybacks up to PIGGYBACK_LIMIT (500) ops, so a conflict whose remote
      //    op falls beyond that window arrives WITHOUT it in `newOps` and takes
      //    exactly this resolution-download fallback in production. We force the
      //    condition rather than generating 500+ ops.)
      //
      //    (a) Pre-upload download (GET before B's first POST): return the REAL
      //        server response with its ops STRIPPED, so B downloads nothing and
      //        never merges A's edit. B then uploads its ORIGINAL (concurrent)
      //        op and the real server returns a real, server-computed
      //        CONFLICT_CONCURRENT — this stays a genuine vector-clock conflict,
      //        not a mock. (Emptying the real response, rather than fabricating
      //        one, keeps the test honest if DownloadOpsResponse changes shape.)
      //    (b) Upload POST: forward it to the real server (so the rejection stays
      //        server-computed), then strip `newOps`/`hasMorePiggyback` from the
      //        response body so the client cannot resolve the conflict from
      //        piggyback and must fall back to the resolution-download GET.
