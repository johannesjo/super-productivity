## :question: How to use it

If you need some help, [this article on dev.to is the best place to start](https://dev.to/johannesjo/getting-started-with-super-productivity-2791).

If you prefer, there is also a (long) [youtube video available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoF2_RSdNXA).

There is another older – the app looks and feels much better now ;) – [article](https://dev.to/johannesjo/super-productivity-how-to-grow-fond-of-time-tracking-and-task-management-22ee) on how I personally might use the app - and still [another one](https://dev.to/johannesjo/the-prioritising-scheme-how-to-eat-the-frog-with-super-productivity-mlk) on how I implement the 'eat the frog' prioritizing scheme in the app.

[If you have further questions, please refer to the discussions page](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/discussions).

## :globe_with_meridians: Web Version

Check out the web version even though it is a bit limited: Time tracking only works if the app is open and for idle time tracking to work, the chrome extension has to be installed.

If you want the Jira integration and idle time tracking to work, you also have to download and install the [Super Productivity Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-productivity/ljkbjodfmekklcoibdnhahlaalhihmlb).

### Running the development server

To run the development server you need to have node installed at least in the version 14. Go to https://nodejs.org for installation instructions.

**Clone repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity.git
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
cd super-productivity
npm i -g @angular/cli
npm i
```

**Run the dev server**

```bash
ng serve
```

Afterwards you can open http://localhost:4200 in your browser. For most adjustments this should be enough and also enables you to use the [redux dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=de).

If you want to run the app standalone do the following:

```bash
ng serve

# in a new console tab
npm start
```

### Packaging the app

Packaging the app is done via [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder). To start packaging run `npm run dist`. If you want to add new platforms and experiment with the build options the easiest way to do so is manipulating the `build` property in the [package.json](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/blob/develop/package.json), but you can also use the [command line interface of electron builder](https://www.electron.build/cli).

## Run as Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 johannesjo/super-productivity:latest
```

## Custom themes (desktop only)

In addition to color coding your projects and tags and to the dark and light theme you can also load completely custom css to restyle everything. To load a custom theme you simply need put them into a new file named `styles.css` directly in the [user data folder](#user-data-folder).

There is a great set of [themes available for download in this repository](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity-themes/tree/main/dist) as well as some [info on how to role out your own custom themes](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity-themes).

## Custom WebDAV Syncing

If using the integrated WebDAV Syncing is not working out for you, you can also try to sync all app files, which are located in the [user data folder](#user-data-folder).

## Automatic Backups

For the desktop version automatic backups are stored per default in the `backup` sub folder of the [user data folder](#user-data-folder). Once you located a backup you can restore it on the settings page under `Sync & Export/Import/Export/Import from file`.

## User Data Folder

Where user data is stored differs from OS to OS. The most common locations are:

| OS          | Location                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mac OS**  | `~/Library/Application Support/superProductivity/`                                              |
| **Windows** | `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\superProductivity/` or `%APPDATA%\superProductivity` |
| **Linux**   | `~/.config/superProductivity/`                                                                  |

The path should be shown when you go to the "Automatic Backups` section on the configuration page (minus the "backup" sub folder). You can also see it printed out when you start the app from the command line.

For web browsers, data is simply stored for the current user inside the browser storage.

### Using a custom folder to save user data

You can specify a custom folder for saving your data by starting the application with the `--user-data-dir` parameter like so:

```bash
superproductivity --user-data-dir=/path/to/my/data
```
