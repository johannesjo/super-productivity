## :question: How to use it
I wrote [a little article](https://dev.to/johannesjo/super-productivity-how-to-grow-fond-of-time-tracking-and-task-management-22ee) on how I use the app. There is also [a youtube video available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoF2_RSdNXA).

## :globe_with_meridians: Web Version
Check out the It is a little bit more limited: Time tracking only works if the app is open and idle time tracking is disabled if the chrome extension is not installed.

If you want the Jira Integration and idle time tracking to work you have also to download and install the [Super Productivity Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-productivity/ljkbjodfmekklcoibdnhahlaalhihmlb).

## :computer: Downloads & Install
### All Platforms
[Install from the releases page](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/releases).

  <img alt="Get it from the Snap Store" src="https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg" />
</a>

### MacOS
Install via [homebrew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask):
```
brew cask install superproductivity
```

### Android
There is a [very early(!) Android version available](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superproductivity.superproductivity&hl=gsw). The sources can be [found here](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity-android).

## :hearts: Contributing
There are several ways to help. 

1. **Spread the word:** More users means more possible people testing and contributing to the app which in turn means better stability and possibly more and better features. You can vote for Super Productivity on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/super-productivity), [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Diary-Organizers-Calendar/Super-Productivity.shtml) or on [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/software/super-productivity/), you can [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20like%20Super%20Productivity%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-productivity.com), share it on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://super-productivity.com&title=I%20like%20Super%20Productivity&) or [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-productivity.com&title=I%20like%20Super%20Productivity). Every little bit helps !

2. **[Make a feature or improvement request](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/issues/new)**: Something can be be done better? Something essential missing? Let us know! 

3. **[Report bugs](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/issues/new)**

4. **Contribute**: You don't have to be programmer to help. Some of the icons really need improvement and many of the translations could use some love. 


### Pull Requests 
**Pull requests** are of course very welcome! Please make sure that you're following the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) and to also include the issue number in your commit message, if you're fixing a particular issue (e.g.: `feat: add nice feature with the number #31`).


### Running the development server
To run the development server you need to have node installed at least in the version 10. Go to https://nodejs.org for installation instructions.

**Clone repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity.git
```
**Install dependencies**
```
cd super-productivity
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
**Run the dev server**
```
ng serve
```
Afterwards you can open http://localhost:4200 in your browser. For most adjustments this should be enough and also enables you to use the [redux dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=de). 

If you want to run the app standalone do the following:
```
ng serve

# in a new console tab
npm start
```

### Packaging the app
Packaging the app is done via [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder). To start packaging run `yarn dist`. If you want to add new platforms and experiment with the build options the easiest way to do so is manipulating the `build` property in the [package.json](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/blob/develop/package.json), but you can also use the [command line interface of electron builder](https://www.electron.build/cli).


## Setup WebDAV Syncing
When starting the app via the command line the path to where emergency backups are saved is printed out to the command line. Just take away the `/backup` sub folder from the path and use the remaining path to sync via the cloud.

## Using a custom folder to save user data
You can specify a custom folder for saving your data by starting the application with the `--user-data-dir` parameter like so:
```
superproductivity --user-data-dir=/path/to/my/data
```

## Automatic Backups
For the desktop version automatic backups are stored per default. You can see the backup folder location printed out when you start the app from the command line. 
Once you located a backup you can restore it on the settings page under`Sync & Export/Import/Export/Import from file`.
